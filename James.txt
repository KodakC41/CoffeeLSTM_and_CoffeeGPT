Today we're gonna review this.
0:01
It's the xBloom coffee brewer,
0:03
something new and unusual
0:04
because it's both a bean-to-cup filter coffee machine,
0:08
but also a pod machine,
0:10
which is something you don't see every day.
0:11
It's a little bit unusual in its design.
0:14
The whole idea behind this is to kind of make a promise.
0:17
Is to say, you, you there,
0:20
do you love delicious filter coffee?
0:22
Do you find the process of brewing it
0:24
annoying and kind of irksome?
0:25
Do you find the whole idea of dialing in a recipe
0:28
eye rollingly irritating rather than kind of fun?
0:30
If that's you, this is who they're trying to reach.
0:33
They're saying this machine's gonna take all the pain away,
0:36
make life easy, and make you kind of perfect,
0:40
well-brewed filter coffee each and every time.
0:44
How will it do that?
0:45
That's the question.
0:46
And ultimately, will it do that?
0:48
Will it deliver on its promise?
0:50
That's what we're here to discuss.
0:52
To explain how this whole thing works,
0:54
we should really start with the pods,
0:57
which are these.
0:59
Now, this is quite a large pod,
1:01
and inside of here will be maybe 15 to 16 grams of coffee,
1:04
depending on which roaster has put coffee inside this thing.
1:08
Now, when you peel open the pod.
1:10
(lid ripping)
1:12
Very satisfying sound.
1:13
You'll find inside coffee beans.
1:15
And those coffee beans are sitting inside
1:17
a very neatly folded coffee filter paper,
1:20
because this pod is not just for storing the coffee,
1:23
this pod is a brewing cone and brewing filter paper,
1:26
all in one.
1:28
Now the magic of this happens when you touch the pod
1:31
[beep]
1:32
to the top of the machine,
1:33
because at the base of this pod is an RFID chip
1:35
that has just told the coffee machine what the coffee is,
1:38
and it's communicated a recipe to it as well.
1:41
On the front of the machine you can see
1:42
a kind of visual representation of that.
1:44
It's showing you firstly grind size,
1:46
so how finely or how coarsely it should grind the coffee.
1:49
Then the brew temperature, how hot the water should be.
1:52
And finally the kind of ratio of coffee to water.
1:56
At this point, we pour the beans in.
1:58
(beans rattling)
2:01
We put this thing in the little tray, the little holder.
2:06
Make sure it's level.
2:07
That is important.
2:09
And then if we push go,
2:10
it's gonna grind coffee and start to brew.
2:13
(electronic beep)
2:14
(machine whirring)
2:18
(beans grinding)
2:22
(machine whirring)
2:27
Now as it's brewing, you can hear it's pretty loud.
2:30
You can hear both the little gurgling
2:31
of the water heater going on,
2:33
but you can also hear quite a loud little PC fan,
2:36
that's sitting inside the body here,
2:37
keeping anything steamy away from the precious electronics.
2:40
(machine agitating)
2:41
And then you can hear that.
2:43
A little jiggle, a little agitation of the grounds
2:46
at the end of the bloom phase,
2:48
something actually I'm kind of into generally.
2:49
I like a little swirl of a V60, sometimes a stir,
2:52
if that suits you better.
2:53
Here it's doing a little side-to-side jiggle.
2:57
At this point, after a period of bloom,
2:59
it will begin to pour the water.
3:01
And how it pours the water is another way
3:04
that it's being unusual, clever,
3:05
and a little bit interesting.
3:07
As you watch this brew,
3:08
you can see that the stream of water is moving around
3:11
on the coffee bed and it's doing that in a very clever way.
3:14
There's no mechanical piece here, nothing's rotating.
3:17
Instead, right at the exit of the spout
3:20
are four I suppose, conductors,
3:23
and by passing a charge through them
3:25
you'll have a kind of electrostatic pull on the water.
3:28
So as you sort of vary the charge around the conductors,
3:32
you can vary the pull on the water that sort of changes
3:35
its direction.
3:36
And without doing anything mechanical,
3:38
you can move a stream of water around.
3:41
Now because the fan is genuinely pretty noisy,
3:44
I'm just gonna wait until it stops brewing
3:46
to talk to you about the coffee that it brews
3:48
and some more about this particular pod.
3:50
So the the brew is now done
3:52
and it seems important to point out
3:54
that there's one big difference between this
3:55
and other pod machines that make filter coffee
3:57
that you might have seen.
3:58
And that's speed.
4:00
This brews in a similar way to someone
4:03
who's brewing a pour over,
4:04
which means that the brew process takes minutes,
4:06
not seconds.
4:07
If you've used things like K-Cups, or Nespresso Vertuo pods,
4:11
or other kind of pod systems,
4:13
they tend to prioritize very rapid brewing.
4:16
Now, there's no real noticeable warmup time here
4:18
Once you turn it on, and put a pod in and start brewing,
4:21
it goes pretty much straight away.
4:23
So it's quick, but the brewing process is relatively slow.
4:28
This brew is obviously a little bit too hot for me
4:30
to taste properly right now,
4:32
but it is a good opportunity to talk about the pod.
4:36
Now this will probably drip on the table,
4:38
but nevermind.
4:39
This pod.
4:42
Now, the pod itself merits some discussion.
4:45
Most people are very anti-pod machines
4:47
because they see pods as contributing to waste,
4:50
be it an aluminum pod,
4:51
be it a different kind of pod.
4:53
People are generally anti-pod from a waste perspective.
4:55
xBloom's approach has been to make this thing
4:58
fully compostable, which is broadly good,
5:00
with the exception, of course,
5:02
of the RFID chip at the bottom.
5:03
So if I was gonna compost this,
5:05
I would need to from the bottom here,
5:08
remove this little RFID chip.
5:11
That would obviously need to be disposed of separately
5:14
to the rest of this pod.
5:15
Now a quick note on composting,
5:16
it doesn't feel as neat and clean and simple
5:18
as I wish it was.
5:19
And that's not an indictment on compostable things.
5:21
That's an indictment on composting services
5:24
where most people live.
5:25
Where this studio is, for example,
5:27
if I put this into my food waste to be composted,
5:30
it along with any other packaging will be removed
5:33
because they can't tell what's compostable and what's not.
5:35
So it all gets taken out.
5:37
If I can try and put it into my garden waste,
5:39
again, destined for compost,
5:41
that will also have any packaging removed and taken out.
5:44
So for me here, the best thing to do
5:46
would be to put the ground coffee into my food waste.
5:48
But this pod, regardless if it's biodegradability,
5:52
is going to end up in landfill in many parts of the world.
5:55
As I said, I'm not criticizing them for that decision.
5:58
I just think it's important to talk about, you know,
6:00
compostable stuff and how it actually figures into our lives
6:03
and our waste disposal systems.
6:05
And I wish composting was kind of better.
6:08
The RFID chip is, it's a point of conflict for me.
6:13
I understand that they're chasing convenience
6:16
for the end user.
6:18
And actually this is a very convenient technology.
6:21
It's a very quick and neat way to communicate
6:24
enough information to have a recipe be transferred over
6:27
or information about the coffee be transferred over.
6:30
I think about what the alternatives could be.
6:32
It would either be something like image recognition
6:34
where either you're gonna take a photo of the pod
6:37
with your phone, or this would have a camera,
6:39
but I really don't want cameras in smart devices
6:42
in my kitchen.
6:43
Or you could do something like the Nespresso Vertuo system
6:45
that uses a barcode in the brew chamber and it scans that.
6:49
But this doesn't really feel like a place
6:50
where I want a barcode scanner hanging out.
6:53
So I struggle with it.
6:55
I understand why they've made the choice.
6:58
I just feel like this has to be excess cost
7:01
and excess waste in a system,
7:03
and I would hope for a better solution in the future
7:07
than this.
7:08
This definitely makes me feel a little uncomfortable
7:09
despite how well it works
7:11
and how seamless it makes the whole process.
7:13
Ultimately, I think it will be one of the biggest points
7:15
of pushback from the broader coffee community
7:18
to this machine and this particular system.
7:20
Now, this tasting glass that I will drink from soon,
7:23
once this is cooled, just a little bit more,
7:26
did come with the coffee machine.
7:27
It was included in the kind of Kickstarter package.
7:30
In addition to that, I got 32 of the pods
7:33
from four different roasters.
7:35
That was good.
7:36
Most of those are now gone.
7:37
I've drunk a lot of them.
7:38
I also got this, which was quite nice,
7:41
is a little a sort of solution to a problem.
7:43
This is some Third Wave Water.
7:45
I've got five sachets there that would make up five gallons.
7:48
This is minerals that you would add to distilled water
7:51
in order to have the right minerality
7:53
for brewing delicious coffee.
7:54
Because it's one of the variables
7:56
that has this massive impact on cup quality,
7:58
on how delicious the coffee is,
7:59
that's actually really hard to control.
8:01
So they're trying to set people up for success
8:03
from the beginning, which I appreciate.
8:05
And the one other thing that came with it,
8:07
which we'll have to talk about a little bit more
8:09
'cause it needs a bit more discussion,
8:10
is this, which is designed to be a kind of reusable pod
8:13
to allow you to use any coffee that you want to use.
8:16
That I think is a good thing.
8:18
They're obviously, you know, sensitive to the idea
8:20
that people don't want to feel locked into a system.
8:23
You know, it's one of the criticisms of pod systems
8:26
is that you can only buy the coffee in the pods.
8:28
You can't brew the coffee that you wanna brew.
8:30
They've said, no, no, no.
8:31
If you put in let's say a Kalita 155 paper filter,
8:35
you can, you know, tap this on top, build out a recipe,
8:38
and you can brew whatever coffee you want to brew.
8:43
And to explain that a little bit more,
8:44
I should probably show you the app that comes with this.
8:47
Because I do like the fact that I don't have to use an app
8:50
to make a coffee.
8:51
I don't get have to get my phone outta my pocket
8:53
in the morning.
8:54
I don't have to suffer dealing with technology.
8:56
I can go beep, pour, brew, and have coffee.
8:59
That seems kind.
9:00
But the app lets you do quite a lot.
9:03
If this brew wasn't to my liking,
9:05
I could make a change to it,
9:06
or I can build a recipe for a coffee
9:09
that xBloom don't know about.
9:10
So I'm in the app and at the start of it
9:12
you can sort of browse some of the roasters
9:14
that they're working with.
9:15
I will say they're working with a selection
9:16
of great roasters who buy and roast great coffee,
9:19
which is good.
9:20
I'm pro that.
9:21
At the top you can see the machine,
9:23
I can tap into the machine.
9:25
Now to explain things, if I put a pod on top,
9:28
(electronic beep)
9:29
you'll see that it detects the pod
9:31
and I can actually tap into that.
9:33
Now in a situation where I may wanna tweak a pod's recipe,
9:36
well, I can do that very easily.
9:38
The first page is quick edit.
9:40
And you'll see if I tap that,
9:41
then I can just move these sliders around.
9:43
Obviously, the smaller the number on the grind size,
9:45
the finer the grind.
9:47
Let me come out of there though and show you get creative,
9:50
which I suppose if you're building out a recipe on your own,
9:53
you might wanna look at this.
9:55
Here you can see a little bit more information.
9:58
And as you watched that pod before,
10:00
you see it did sort of multiple pours
10:03
rather than one continuous pour.
10:04
And you can edit each of those continuous pours.
10:07
So here there's quite a lot of little pours
10:09
in this particular recipe.
10:10
I can sort of swipe across and see them.
10:12
And I can change the volume of each pour,
10:14
it's brew temperature.
10:14
I can change the pattern with which the spout
10:17
dispenses water.
10:18
I can do a little vibration before or after.
10:21
And it can also change my beverage size
10:24
and my grind size at the top.
10:26
Let's just say I wanna take that, oh, just a touch finer.
10:29
There we go.
10:30
Now when I save that,
10:31
I can save that as a brand new profile,
10:34
which is interesting.
10:35
Now, if I wanted to, I could even turn this profile
10:39
into the default for this particular pod,
10:41
which means that whenever I use that pod
10:42
without getting my phone out,
10:44
it would use my profile,
10:45
and not the one that's kind of baked into it,
10:47
which is nice if you feel like you know more
10:50
than the machine or you want it to brew differently
10:52
than how it wants to brew.
10:54
And this is something I've definitely thought
10:58
quite a lot about,
10:58
but I'll tell you about that in a little bit.
11:01
Overall, I think a well-built app, pretty easy to use.
11:06
That's kind of all good.
11:08
I'm not really gonna complain about that at all.
11:10
We're not done talking about this though.
11:12
We'll come back to this.
11:13
But I do need to now taste some coffee
11:15
and talk about how that has been.
11:21
That is a pretty well-brewed cup of coffee.
11:25
I would say it's not a particularly flawed cup of coffee,
11:28
but at the same time I would say that it is not reaching
11:31
the absolute full potential of the coffee.
11:34
And I think there's a couple of different reasons for that.
11:37
One of those is kind of wrapped up
11:39
in a philosophical discussion.
11:41
Let me take you back to my first experiences
11:43
with this machine.
11:45
When we got it out of the box
11:46
and we started brewing with it,
11:47
the coffee it produced was extremely disappointing.
11:50
It was extremely under extracted.
11:52
If you know a little bit about extraction science,
11:54
that'll make sense.
11:55
Basically, when you grind coffee,
11:57
about 30% of it is soluble, but you don't want all 30%.
12:01
Typically, people are looking for somewhere between 20
12:04
and 23% of the coffee to be extracted into the cup below.
12:08
If you get less than that, the brew is not only weak,
12:11
but not really balanced and sweet.
12:13
And that's what we were getting.
12:14
We were getting kind of 17% extractions,
12:17
weak under extracted brews.
12:19
The grind was too coarse.
12:20
At that point you're like, wait, wait, wait.
12:22
The whole promise of this machine
12:24
is that you just put the pod on top,
12:26
pour the coffee in, it takes care of everything.
12:29
How could this be wrong?
12:31
And the issue was ultimately one of a grind calibration.
12:35
Now having spoken to xBloom,
12:37
they're very confident in how they calibrate
12:39
these at factory.
12:40
But I definitely had an issue with this machine
12:43
that was relatively easy to resolve.
12:45
Inside the app there's a setting to go to for the grinder.
12:48
And you can run an auto calibrate function
12:50
to kinda recalibrate everything.
12:51
And that has definitely improved the coffee
12:53
that this thing is brewing.
12:55
Now extractions are more like 19, 19.5%.
13:00
That's the kind of range where,
13:02
I don't know if I am struggling
13:04
with the roaster's interpretation of the coffee,
13:06
or the machine's delivery
13:08
of the roaster's brew method, right?
13:10
Like, the roaster chose the grind setting,
13:12
the roaster chose the brew temperature,
13:13
and the ratio, and the pours, and all of that stuff.
13:15
Were they aiming for 19.5% in the cup
13:19
or is my grind still a fraction coarse?
13:23
I don't know.
13:25
I don't know the answer to that.
13:26
It's not a bad cup, but I know it could be a better cup,
13:30
and that leaves me a little bit kind of confused
13:32
and conflicted.
13:33
It could be, it's doing exactly what the roaster wanted
13:36
and they prefer that kind of lighter extraction,
13:39
that not kind of,
13:40
they don't wanna get into the 20s,
13:42
they don't wanna go higher.
13:43
They prefer this.
13:44
And that's not wrong.
13:46
If that's what they like, that's what they like.
13:48
There's no right and wrong in coffee.
13:49
It is kind of annoying.
13:51
I wish there was a right and wrong.
13:52
I wish there was a this is doing exactly right or it's not.
13:55
But it's brewing pretty good coffee.
13:57
But I, if I had this, I would definitely be in
14:01
and tweaking the recipes, certainly from a grind size
14:04
for most of the pods that I've brewed.
14:06
Not by a lot.
14:07
I think, originally I would say the original grind setting
14:10
was out by like six or seven steps on the grinder.
14:14
Now, I might adjust one or two.
14:16
So it's definitely improved.
14:18
But, you know, as an experience that promises maximum ease,
14:21
I'm not sure that's entirely what I was delivered.
14:25
These things happen.
14:26
This is a Kickstarter.
14:27
I paid $400 for it, not $800, which is the list price.
14:32
And the nature of backing a Kickstarter says
14:35
you are getting a discount 'cause you are taking a gamble.
14:38
And the issue that I had was minor and easily resolved.
14:41
So I'm not out to sort of damn xBloom for this issue
14:45
because it's been fixed and the coffee is much better.
14:48
But it has wrapped me
14:49
into this weird philosophical conundrum
14:51
where I don't know how the coffee's supposed to taste,
14:54
which is kind of weird.
14:55
Now, there is one other issue I wanna talk about
14:57
that is not to do with the grinder,
14:59
but is to do with how it sort of delivers water,
15:02
and how the kind of pouring thing works.
15:05
If you get nerdy about pouring water onto coffee,
15:07
which unfortunately has happened to me,
15:09
you'll know that if you have a stream of water
15:12
fall into the kind of coffee brewing liquid,
15:15
then that's a good thing because the sort of energy
15:17
of the water falling is translated
15:19
and it will agitate the bed underneath.
15:21
If you pour slowly enough that the pour
15:24
breaks up into droplets,
15:26
what you see is actually that energy
15:27
becomes sort of dissipated and as the droplet hits,
15:31
the energy kind of goes sideways but not down.
15:33
Like it doesn't seem to churn the coffee underneath
15:36
the same way.
15:37
Here, the water breaks before it hits the coffee bed.
15:40
And so I think it's doing less agitation
15:43
that I would say is desirable.
15:45
To double check my theory,
15:46
I did separately have the machine grind some coffee
15:49
that I brewed with a pouring kettle.
15:51
And it's not the most scientific of tests.
15:53
But in those comparisons I preferred the pouring kettle
15:57
each and every time.
15:57
I just preferred that additional level of agitation.
16:00
It just felt like the coffee was a little sweeter.
16:02
I got a little bit more out of it.
16:04
I wish the stream did not break before it hit the bed
16:08
of the coffee.
16:09
Let's talk about the price of the pods.
16:10
You buy them directly from xBloom
16:12
and they have a couple of different price points.
16:15
In my money, in the British Sterling,
16:19
32 pods cost £39 or £26,
16:22
which is I think around £1.20 per pod
16:25
or 80 pence a pod.
16:26
At 80 pence a pod, you are closer to specialty pod,
16:30
kind of prices.
16:31
Even though most specialty pods contain
16:33
five or six grams of coffee,
16:34
rather than 15 or 16 grams of coffee.
16:37
£1.20 that is much more expensive.
16:41
I'm not saying that coffee should be cheaper,
16:43
I'm not saying that at all.
16:44
I'm just saying it is relatively expensive per cup.
16:47
Now this unit is a 110 volt unit.
16:49
This is not built for Europe.
16:51
They have not launched in Europe.
16:52
They are launching May 25th I think in North America,
16:56
so US and Canada.
16:58
220 volt is coming later.
17:00
I'm obviously running this on a beefy transformer underneath
17:03
here to make sure we're all safe and sound.
17:04
Now you can argue, coming back to this,
17:07
that you don't have to use their pods.
17:09
You get the reusable pod with this.
17:12
But this is suddenly comparable to kind of going back
17:17
to having a V60, and a grinder,
17:20
and a pouring kettle yourself.
17:22
And going back to doing the work of dialing in,
17:25
of deciding how to pour,
17:26
and deciding how hot your water should be.
17:28
You know, you still have to go and build a recipe for this.
17:32
And so this is kind of interesting to me
17:34
because it's very nice to have it.
17:36
It's nice not to have people feel like they're locked in,
17:39
but actually the lock-in still happens
17:41
from a workflow and convenience perspective.
17:44
I don't think people who buy this machine
17:46
are gonna be using this all that much.
17:49
Lovely if a friend gives you a bag of coffee to try
17:51
and play with, and you're like, "Oh, I can brew that."
17:53
But it'll be a bit of work, a bit of decision-making.
17:56
I feel like this machine appeals to people
17:58
who don't want to do the work and the decision-making.
18:01
So it's a kind of weird one for me.
18:04
But I think it's a very good thing that they've done it
18:06
and I'm pro them shipping this.
18:07
I think that's a good thing.
18:09
While we're on the topic of good things,
18:11
I would say that the grinder inside this is a good grinder.
18:14
It's a conical burr grinder.
18:16
It does, I think a very good job.
18:18
I like the cups that it's capable of producing.
18:20
So from that point of view,
18:22
you're getting a pretty good grinder inside this.
18:24
I'm not sure it's at the level
18:26
of something like the Ode Gen 2,
18:28
which I think probably makes better tasting coffee,
18:30
but it's not that far away.
18:33
Like, it's still making tasty, sweet clean cups.
18:35
There's not too much mess.
18:36
There's a little bit of mess around the grinder.
18:38
This plate here comes off.
18:41
There'll be a little bit of coffee inside
18:42
and on the underside.
18:44
Different coffees seem to have different static quantities.
18:47
It's a little bit messy,
18:48
but not horrifically messy by any stretch.
18:50
If you look under the grinder,
18:51
you'll see a little kind of paperclip thing.
18:53
That's doing a little declumping distribution work
18:55
from the bottom of the grinder.
18:57
Obviously, the coffee's coming into here
18:58
and being spread between the four holes
19:00
to distribute it evenly into the filter paper,
19:03
into the pod, which is pretty good.
19:05
It does have these four little mound
19:08
that you see in the pod,
19:08
and I wish I could kind of get in there,
19:10
and shake it level before the brew starts,
19:13
but that's not really what they want you to do.
19:14
So I'm not sure I'm gonna recommend you try and do that.
19:17
But overall, I don't really have much in the way
19:20
of complaints about the grinder.
19:22
But I do still have some other complaints, I'm afraid.
19:25
Firstly, probably the biggest one for me
19:28
that's kind of confusing,
19:29
well, it's tied to the dimensions.
19:31
Now, this machine is very tall and for some people too tall,
19:36
if you're trying to, you know,
19:37
operate this underneath some kitchen cabinets,
19:39
this may be a little bit too high.
19:41
It is a very tall machine.
19:42
And they've chosen to go very tall, not very wide,
19:45
and a little bit deep, but not really very deep.
19:48
As a result of that, the water tank, oh,
19:55
is very small.
19:56
It's very small.
19:57
It is at its maximum capacity 700 milliliters.
20:01
That means that you can brew two cups out of this
20:04
before you need to refill it.
20:06
Not three, just the two.
20:08
A typical cup's gonna be around 250 mls,
20:10
so it's not like a seven 50 ml tank where you might squeeze
20:13
three cups out.
20:14
It's two with a bit left over.
20:16
There are environments where I could see this machine
20:18
working like an office,
20:19
but then if you have to refill the water tank
20:22
every two cups,
20:23
suddenly I feel like the office would be constantly
20:25
complaining about the coffee machine
20:27
that you constantly have to fill up.
20:28
And if it's, you know, you and someone else at home
20:31
making coffee in the morning,
20:32
every day you're filling the tank.
20:33
If you wanna brew two or three cups a day,
20:35
you're filling the tank.
20:37
It just feels like they could have
20:41
made the machine a little bit deeper,
20:44
a tiny little bit wider,
20:45
and given a substantially larger water tank to it
20:48
that wouldn't have been as frustrating for most people
20:52
when it comes to the kind of refilling piece of this thing.
20:54
It just feels slightly anti the whole high convenience,
20:57
easy experience that the rest of the machine
20:59
is trying to offer.
21:00
In terms of other nitpicks, the display on the front,
21:04
I kind of don't get it, really.
21:08
When you put a pod on top and you see the recipe come up,
21:11
that isn't really information I can read.
21:13
At best, it's just telling me that a recipe
21:15
has been communicated,
21:17
but I can't really see, you know, any numbers here.
21:20
It's just a rough representation.
21:23
In addition, I feel like a little bit of a lie.
21:26
At the top of the brew temps here it says
21:28
99 degrees Celsius.
21:29
This thing can run its water heater at 99 Celsius,
21:32
but it can only produce water at 95 Celsius
21:35
from the dispense.
21:36
It just seems a little bit odd to tell me one thing,
21:39
but actually in the app and other places
21:41
offer me a different number.
21:43
And so in conclusion I find myself a little bit impressed
21:47
and a little bit disappointed by the xBloom,
21:49
but ultimately kind of hopeful.
21:52
There are challenges that I hope they can fix and overcome.
21:56
The RFID chip as one,
21:58
the sort of breaking up with the stream as another.
22:00
It's doing a high convenience thing
22:02
and it's doing a reasonable job.
22:04
I just wish it was doing a slightly better job
22:08
on the extraction.
22:09
I wish the extractions were just a little bit higher
22:11
so that I was still confident that, that's exactly how
22:14
the roaster wanted that coffee.
22:15
And I definitely, definitely, definitely don't have
22:17
a calibration issue still.
22:19
I still worry that this grinder is set one or two steps
22:23
coarser than it should be,
22:24
despite me running the calibration on it.
22:27
But I can't know that because I don't know
22:29
what the roaster was trying to achieve.
22:31
You get my frustration here, right?
22:33
Like, you understand that kind of gray area
22:36
is, to someone like me, maddening.
22:39
But it's brewing good coffee.
22:41
And if it gets more people drinking great coffee
22:44
and buying good coffee from good roasters,
22:47
that I think is probably a good thing.
22:49
Not everyone wants to go through the rigmarole
22:51
of dialing in a grinder doing all that stuff themselves.
22:54
They like the fact that you can get a grinder,
22:57
and a kettle, and a robot in between them.
23:00
The price, list price, which is $800,
23:03
which they're now selling on their website for,
23:05
is definitely a challenging price.
23:07
That's a lot more than a good grinder and a kettle.
23:11
That, you know, the cost of the convenience,
23:12
the cost of the robot in between is pretty high.
23:15
Having paid $400 for it,
23:17
I feel pretty good about that value.
23:18
But if I was paying 800, that is to me a tougher sell.
23:23
But now I want to hear from you.
23:25
I think they've shipped about 1000 of these,
23:27
a bit more now.
23:27
I think they raised about half million on Kickstarter.
23:29
So these are out there in the wild.
23:31
People are using them every day.
23:33
How are you getting on with it?
23:34
Have you had good brews?
23:36
Have you been impressed?
23:36
Have you had like me some issues
with the grinder calibration?
Or did it brew perfectly straight out of the box?
23:42
Are you disappointed?
23:44
Are you surprised?
23:44
Are you delighted?
23:46
If you have one of these,
23:47
I really want to hear from you down in the comments below,
23:49
and if you're considering it,
23:51
well, what aspect of this didn't we cover enough?
23:54
Drop a question and I'll try and answer it wherever I can.
23:56
But for now I will say thank you so much for watching
24:00
and I hope you have a great day.
0:00
Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking.
0:15
You're thinking: This is clickbait.
0:17
It's not.
0:17
I will explain.
0:18
And, you might also be thinking:
0:20
Well, actually, I make beautiful espresso.
0:23
And I'm sure you do.
0:24
The short version of this is
0:26
that espresso now tastes better.
0:29
But, we should go back.
0:31
Back to maybe 15 years ago
0:35
when espresso was very beautiful.
0:37
Now, the gold standard of espresso, when I go into it,
0:40
the gold standard of how espresso should look was,
0:42
without question, David Schomer.
0:45
Maybe it was just that I was, you know,
0:47
young and impressionable at that time, but I don't think
0:49
there's really ever been a more beautiful kind of pour
0:52
than the sort of stuff David Schomer used to do.
0:54
The way the espresso sort of fell from the spouts.
0:57
It was just, it looked so good.
1:04
The way we made espresso was really,
1:06
we were trying to use a lot of visual information
1:08
and so it's not particularly surprising
1:10
that I look back at it, that we were optimizing
1:12
what we were doing for the best looking espresso
1:15
because it was how it looked
1:17
that informed the decisions we made
1:18
about whether something was good or bad.
1:20
Whether it was pouring well or badly.
1:23
There's kinda three separate things I want to talk about.
1:25
One, I want to talk about the way espresso falls
1:27
from the spouts.
1:28
That's changed.
1:29
Two, I want to talk about how it kind of looks in the cup.
1:32
The crema.
1:33
And we're gonna talk about tiger striping, too.
1:36
We'll get there.
1:37
So let's talk about the way that, you know,
1:40
the coffee pours.
1:41
How good it looks.
1:42
'Cause these days, espresso as it pours does not look
1:45
as good as it used to.
1:47
Tastes better but it doesn't look as good.
1:49
And there's a couple of reasons for this.
1:51
Ultimately, the recipe, the way that we've brewed,
1:53
has fundamentally changed.
1:54
Back in the day, grinding fresh was kind of new
1:56
and the way that the coffee was dosed was to use the basket.
2:00
To fill the basket as a way of dosing
2:01
a consistent amount of coffee.
2:07
This was way more coffee than people had used in the past.
2:10
For like that very traditional 14 gram double espresso
2:13
from Italy, we were suddenly doing
2:15
kind of 20, 22 gram doses.
2:17
Along with that, well those didn't taste very good,
2:20
if you didn't adapt the way you roasted, right?
2:22
Like, it was really hard to extract 20, 22 grams
2:25
in a normal basket, so people started to roast darker.
2:27
Now, let's talk about water for a second.
2:30
Little tiny bit of science here.
2:32
Water is a polar substance.
2:34
Each water molecule has a kind of positively charged end
2:37
and a negatively charged end.
2:38
So if you let water hang out,
2:40
it kinda wants to stick to itself.
2:42
That's what creates surface tension
2:44
and it has a property called cohesion.
2:47
Right, it wants to be attracted to itself.
2:50
It also has a property called adhesion
2:52
where it wants to stick to other things
2:54
because of this kind of magnetic charge.
2:57
Now there is something you can do
2:58
that messes with adhesion and cohesion.
3:01
That messes with water's relationship,
3:03
its magnetism to itself: And that's dissolve stuff in it.
3:07
So the more stuff that you dissolve,
3:09
the more stuff gets between the water molecules
3:11
and the harder it is for them to stick together.
3:13
Why is this relevant?
3:15
A good question.
3:16
Let's go back to looking at how an espresso brews.
3:18
So at the start when the espresso brews,
3:20
that first liquid coming through the puck
3:22
that is chock-full of soluble material.
3:25
And as a result, it's not very sticky anymore.
3:27
So that espresso falls straight down from the spout.
3:30
As your espresso progresses, you'll notice
3:31
that it starts to cling a little bit more to the spouts
3:34
and it starts to sort of arch inwards.
3:36
And that's really just saying,
3:37
how strong is the liquid flowing through.
3:40
Now, the way that we've changed brewing has gone
3:42
from massive doses in and relatively short doses out.
3:46
Which meant that almost your entire pour
3:48
was chock-full of solubles.
3:50
It still might be under-extracted at the end of it,
3:52
'cause you've just got so much coffee to extract
3:55
but it looked beautiful.
3:57
And we would often stop, sort of brewing, the moment
4:00
that it seems to be a little thinner,
4:02
that it went kind of blonde or whatever we said back then.
4:05
That was the end point.
4:06
It was purely visual.
4:07
Now that we know that actually there's still good stuff
4:10
coming out of the spouts at that point
4:12
and typically would bring lower doses again.
4:15
We had kind of shifted back from like 20, 22
4:17
down to like 16 to 18 grams.
4:19
We were also brewing more liquid in the espresso.
4:22
So it's getting bigger,
4:25
therefore, pushing more water through
4:26
and that water is gonna be weaker,
4:29
it's gonna have less dissolves stuff in it.
4:31
It's gonna cling to the spouts more.
4:33
And I kind of miss how good
4:35
old espresso used to look, right?
4:37
Like that old-school massive dose, it just looked so pretty.
4:41
It looked so good brewing.
4:42
I think, like in competitions you'd be watching people's
4:45
pours to see at what point they started to cling
4:47
to the spouts a little bit more and sort of lose
4:50
that straight beautiful drop there.
4:52
And these days, they don't drop straight down for long.
4:55
Pretty quickly they start to pull inwards
4:57
and that's just the way that we're brewing has changed.
4:59
It's changed the nature and the strength
5:01
of the liquid coming out.
5:03
So that's why, that's one of the reasons,
5:05
that espresso is no longer quite as beautiful
5:07
as it was before.
5:08
Well, one other subject,
5:09
I do wanna talk a little bit about crema.
5:10
Now, I am not the biggest fan of the taste of crema.
5:14
Like it doesn't, you know you get a spoonful that's not good
5:16
and taking it off an espresso
5:18
and drinking that without its crema is an interesting
5:20
and enjoyable little exercise.
5:22
So it's important to remember
5:22
that crema is really just a foam of the liquid below it.
5:26
It's not different or separate.
5:27
It's not special.
5:28
It's just foam, right?
5:30
And the color of that foam is pretty much related
5:33
to the color of the beverage down below.
5:35
Now, as I've said before we're pulling
5:38
ultimately weaker shots of espresso.
5:41
Better tasting, better extracted, more balanced,
5:43
more flavorsome you might argue.
5:45
Not as textured and rich and decadent but, but delicious.
5:49
Now that liquid is weaker.
5:51
And as a result if you make a foam from a paler liquid
5:53
you'll get a paler foam.
5:55
And don't forget, the color of coffee itself comes from
5:58
what are called melanoidins,
5:59
like brown byproducts of roasting.
6:02
And the darker you'll roast something,
6:03
the more of these there'll be.
6:05
The deeper, the richer the red brown you'll have.
6:07
You can't get stunningly deep red brown crema
6:10
from pretty light roasts.
6:11
It can't be done.
6:12
You haven't generated enough of those melanoidins
6:15
and those kind of compounds that give coffee its color.
6:18
Very dark roasts will produce darker, richer looking crema
6:22
and then also produce a bit more CO2.
6:25
They'll age a bit quicker, so they'll degas faster
6:27
'cause they're more brittle and that roasting process
6:29
kind of makes the whole coffee bean more porous
6:32
and so it does age a little quicker,
6:34
but fresh it will have more CO2.
6:37
In addition, if you really want to get into the old-school,
6:39
if you are still using like a little tickle of robusta
6:41
which I believe for a long time, for example David Schomer,
6:44
a little tickle of Robusta in there.
6:45
Robusta has less oil in the bean naturally
6:48
than arabica does.
6:49
About half the amount.
6:51
And oil is the enemy of foam.
6:52
If you've made meringues, you will know this to be true.
6:56
Right, like fat destroys foam
6:58
for reasons we'll maybe talk about another time.
7:00
But don't forget, robusta will give you not only more crema
7:03
but longer lasting crema.
7:05
More stable crema.
7:07
Doesn't taste good, I think, most of it.
7:10
There's better, there's worse this is not the time.
7:13
And the last thing I wanna touch upon
7:14
is what we typically call tiger stripes.
7:17
It's like a beautiful flecking across the top of the crema.
7:20
It looks very beautiful.
7:22
You feel like you've made something very beautiful
7:24
when you make an espresso like this.
7:26
Now, this whole rant actually came
7:28
from a trip I took recently to Italy.
7:31
And I pulled some shots.
7:32
And one of the shots I've pulled
7:33
of kind of local coffee there just looked very pretty.
7:36
And it reminded me that espresso doesn't really look like
7:38
this day to day anymore.
7:39
And I felt a little nostalgic.
7:41
I felt a little sad but it was also,
7:42
I was like wow maybe that's something to talk about here,
7:45
in terms of the science of coffee
7:46
and why things are the way that they are.
7:48
Now, tiger striping that's essentially just lots
7:51
of tiny piece of ground coffee trapped in the crema.
7:55
And as you brew, typically you're espresso pour
7:57
hits one side of the cup, drags the foam underneath
8:00
and it kind of pulls the remaining crema across the cup,
8:03
causing these kind of flecks to spread out as you brew.
8:08
Again, to kind of brew this way you would need to be
8:13
grinding quite a brittle coffee, so you get a lot more
8:15
of these tiny little grinds that come out at the start.
8:17
You do sometimes see them with lighter roasts
8:19
and that kind of stuff, but it's relatively rare
8:21
compared to how it used to be.
8:23
And those are a few thoughts on why modern espresso
8:25
doesn't look as good as it used to.
8:26
I'm not out here, trying to trash-talk what you make,
8:29
what you enjoy that's not the point.
8:30
And if you like the old-school style of stuff,
8:32
that's okay, too.
8:33
I'm not trying to say that it's worse.
8:34
I know I said that it tastes better now,
8:36
but it's maybe more to my tastes, I guess.
8:39
I'll hold my hands up there.
8:40
All I'm trying to say is that it's kind of interesting,
8:43
the way that modern techniques
8:45
have impacted the look of espresso.
8:47
And that maybe, you know, it's okay to be a little nostalgic
8:51
for how things used to look.
8:53
It was a very satisfying part of being a barista,
8:55
producing gorgeous-looking shots.
8:57
You don't taste most of what you make in a day,
8:59
so if it looks fantastic that does feel kind of good.
9:02
Anyway, I welcome your thoughts.
9:05
I don't really know what you're gonna say.
9:07
I'm kind of interested.
9:08
Do you think I've lost my mind?
9:09
Do you think I'm totally off the beaten track?
9:11
Have you been making espresso for a long time?
9:13
Do you feel like there's been a real shift?
9:16
Do you sometimes get sad that the best tasting espressos
9:18
don't look as good as they used to?
9:22
Let me know your thoughts.
9:23
I'll be interested to talk to you about it
9:25
in the comments down below.
9:26
As always, thank you for watching.
9:29
I hope you have a great day.
0:00
Today we're gonna answer a question that nobody asked.
0:20
Can you make a liquid taste just like a donut
0:22
and can you combine it with coffee for a good time?
0:25
Now I happen to know
0:26
that the answer to this is yes, permit me a little story.
0:29
It's 2007, I'm competing in the UK Barista Championships.
0:34
I will win that year
0:35
and go to the World Championships in Tokyo
0:37
and I'll win that one too and if you wanna see me
0:39
talk through the whole Barista Competition routine,
0:41
there's a video up here.
0:42
But in the UK, I was working on a signature drink.
0:45
It's a drink that you make that can have alcohol in,
0:47
must taste of coffee
0:48
but that's really where the rules kind of end.
0:51
And at that time, I was obsessed
0:52
with trying to make a liquid pastry.
0:55
Now initially, I was trying to replicate the taste
0:57
of a kind of a laminated dough, be it like a croissant
0:59
or something like that but none of it worked
1:02
and there was a kind of acidity that was very unpleasant
1:04
from all of the sort of fermentation of the dough.
1:07
I thought I'd hit a dead end.
1:09
That is, until I went to see my friend Chris Young.
1:12
Now at the time, he was the head of the lab
1:14
at the Fat Duck restaurant.
1:15
He was doing all the kind of crazy food science.
1:17
We were friends, we would hang out a little bit
1:18
and he said that the pastry chef from El Bulli,
1:21
Ferran Adria's restaurant in Spain at the time,
1:24
probably the most famous, most kind of well-known
1:27
experimental interesting restaurant in the world.
1:29
Apparently, the pastry chef
1:31
thought that a freshly fried and glazed
1:33
Krispy Kreme original glazed donut was a perfect dessert.
1:37
And in 2007, I don't think I'd had one
1:39
but I went and I sought one out and yeah,
1:42
fresh off the line, it was incredible.
1:45
And so I began a quest to turn this
1:48
into a liquid because I figured
1:49
that plus coffee would be delicious.
1:52
Turns out I was right and today, I'll show you the process,
1:55
I'll give you the recipe.
1:56
It's really very simple.
1:57
On stage in the competitions,
1:59
it got complicated because there was a kind of time crunch.
2:01
We don't have that pressure here
2:02
so we're gonna do it a much easier way.
2:04
To start with you need some donuts.
2:06
Now, you don't have to use Krispy Kreme,
2:08
I just think they have quite a strong signature flavor.
2:11
This isn't sponsored by them in any way,
2:14
you could use whatever donuts you wanna use,
2:15
if you like the flavor of those donuts.
2:16
I just think these are easy to find.
2:18
Now I've gone for the vegan version today
2:20
'cause I'm kind of curious.
2:21
So I'm gonna do a vegan version
2:22
but you could do this with a regular version and dairy milk,
2:25
that works just fine, up to you.
2:27
This is the recipe.
2:28
For every 100 mils of milk that you're gonna use,
2:31
you're gonna use one donut.
2:32
So here, I'm gonna keep things simple.
2:34
I'm gonna do four donuts to 400 mils of liquid.
2:37
Take your donuts, chop them into little pieces.
2:40
I would say probably eight pieces is enough.
2:43
You're gonna squish, smoosh these things
2:46
once they're in the liquid
2:48
so don't worry too much about it.
2:50
And they need a bit of a squish to get them all in.
2:55
Let's do three more.
3:00
And then just 400 mils, in this case,
3:02
of milk or plant-based milk.
3:05
Combine and then we're gonna gently heat it
3:07
and give it a good smoosh together.
3:08
It's gonna become a slightly unsettling soupy mix.
3:12
Don't freak out, this is totally fine.
3:14
Don't worry about that at all.
3:15
You're gonna heat it up, not too hot.
3:17
I don't wanna get to the point
3:18
where the milk has started to cook
3:19
and change its taste or kind of texture.
3:21
So here, I would say probably 40 to 50 degrees Celsius,
3:25
just heat it up gently
3:26
and then let it infuse for maybe 20 minutes.
3:28
Okay, so it's time to do the first straining.
3:31
Now, you're gonna be a little unsettled
3:32
because it kinda looks a bit porridgy at this point,
3:35
don't worry.
3:36
By the time we get it to a drink,
3:37
it'll be clean and delicious and wonderful
3:39
but we are gonna have to do a little bit of straining.
3:42
Now, ideally, have a biggest sieve than mine
3:46
'cause what we're gonna need to do
3:47
is let's take a little at a time
3:50
and then we kinda wanna squeeze and press it out.
3:53
All of the liquid that's inside,
3:54
the sort of soggy donut,
3:58
we need that out
3:59
'cause that's the best tasting liquid of all.
4:01
So we're gonna gently press it through
4:03
and then whatever's left, I mean you could eat it,
4:06
I wouldn't but you could.
4:09
So here we have round one.
4:11
Now, if we just steamed this and put it into coffee,
4:13
the texture is actually not that good.
4:15
The little tiny bits of dough still in there,
4:17
it needs a fine strain.
4:18
It's actually a little bit too kind of fatty
4:20
and kind of greasy like this.
4:22
So it needs a second kind of cleaning up and separation.
4:25
Now in the competition,
4:26
I took a slightly extreme route,
4:27
which was I put it into a centrifuge,
4:28
running at -20 degrees Celsius
4:30
to very quickly chill down any fat there,
4:32
to be sort of more solid and then spin it out quite easily
4:35
and that definitely worked.
4:37
A little bit of chaos to try and use
4:38
the centrifuge onstage at that time.
4:40
Also, the company that hired that to me
4:42
were kind of grossed out that I was doing this with it
4:44
but that's by the by.
4:45
We could use a centrifuge but that just seems a bit extreme
4:47
for something that is just kind of a little bit
4:49
of fun and a silly thing to make for some friends.
4:52
What we're gonna do, it's much simpler.
4:54
We're just gonna chill it down, chill it down,
4:56
fridge temp, sort of four degrees Celsius ideally
4:59
and leave it until that kind of fat
5:02
will solidify a little bit more,
5:03
it'd be much easier to strain out.
5:05
So I'm gonna leave this in the fridge for a little while
5:08
and will come back to it later.
5:10
This recipe, all the instructions, all that kinda stuff
5:12
is on my website.
5:14
A website that I built with this video sponsor
5:17
which is Squarespace.
5:18
If you need a website or domain,
5:19
then I would recommend checking out Squarespace.
5:21
I use Squarespace whenever I build a website now
5:23
because it's just so simple and easy
5:25
to produce something truly beautiful.
5:27
I can take one of their templates
5:28
and whether it's for an event or it's for a book
5:31
or for a portfolio of my work,
5:33
I can easily create something that I know will look great
5:35
across every device, every browser.
5:37
There's nothing to patch, upgrade or install,
5:40
it's intuitive and it's easy to use.
5:41

5:51
Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video.
5:54
We return.
5:55
We've had a sort of a good chilling down
5:58
and you can actually see on top of here,
5:59
there's been a little bit
6:00
of sort of separation and solidifying
6:02
of some of the oil inside this whole thing
6:04
and that's good news.
6:05
So what we're gonna do
6:06
is we're gonna sieve this a couple of times.
6:07
Firstly, just to do a kind of quick pass through the sieve,
6:10
we'll probably catch some lumps of stuff.
6:12
We can get rid of that
6:14
and then we'll do a finer sieve again afterwards.
6:16
And so that's a pretty good start.
6:18
We could go finer again in terms of sieving
6:20
to get a better end texture
6:22
and kind of cleaner tasting drink in a way.
6:23
Now you could use muslin if you wanted to use that,
6:26
for me, I don't love using that,
6:28
I think it's super effective
6:29
and you could use a coffee filter paper
6:31
but that tends to take forever.
6:34
So from Dave Arnold, I learned this trick, a tea towel.
6:37
A clean tea towel is actually a pretty good
6:39
filtration medium for this kind of stuff,
6:41
which is what we're gonna do.
6:42
Now, the more you sieve this, the cleaner will get
6:44
and the more enjoyable it will be to drink, for sure.
6:47
It's pretty delicious right now
6:48
but if you've got a fine sieve, definitely use that.
6:51
The finer the sieve, the better.
6:52
For now, we're gonna run with it.
6:54
We're gonna keep it simple, nice and easy.
6:56
I'm gonna steam this up,
6:57
pour it into a little bit espresso drink.
7:02
For ours shot, I'm gonna use a double here,
7:05
just 'cause I'm not gonna have this very often
7:06
so I might as well do it right.
7:07
This, as I recall, is quite difficult to steam,
7:10
you gotta be quite aggressive at the start
7:11
to get some air into it and then you should be okay.
7:14
Now obviously this liquid has a slightly higher fat content
7:16
so it is harder to to pour,
7:18
the foam's a little bit more fragile
7:20
and you can go from anywhere
7:21
from a one-to-one to one to two,
7:23
in terms of the amount of liquid you're gonna add in.
7:27
I never got good latte out with this back in the day.
7:33
So here we have coffee and a donut, all in one.
7:35
A nice layer of firm, sweet, donuty milk,
7:38
a delicious espresso.
7:39
Let's have a taste.
7:45
It's like, it's almost too obvious in terms of what it is.
7:49
It tastes exactly like you think it would taste.
7:52
It tastes like I'm drinking
7:53
a Krispy Kreme original glazed donut
7:56
with a delicious shot of espresso in there too.
7:59
Now this is not crazy sweet
8:01
and so I would say adding about five grams of sugar
8:03
per 100 mils of liquid will get you to a pretty tasty point.
8:07
If you'd like something a little bit more decadent,
8:09
it's just like drinking a pastry and you could argue,
8:10
why not just eat the pastry
8:12
but sometimes it's fun to have fun.
8:15
That's all I'm saying.
8:16
It's fun to have fun, fun to do something different,
8:18
fun to surprise your friends
8:19
with a weird little drink that really anyone could enjoy.
8:22
If they like coffee, if they like donuts,
8:24
they'll enjoy this.
8:25
It'll be a surprise, a treat, some fun.
8:27
But now I wanna hear from you.
8:28
What'd you try this?
8:29
Does this sound like fun?
8:30
Does this sound just completely ridiculous?
8:34
If you do try it, leave us a comment down below.
8:36
Let me know how you get on.
8:37
Let me know which donuts you use.
8:38
Let me know how the whole process went.
8:40
I really wanna hear from you
8:42
down in the comments below but for now,
8:44
I'll say thank you so much for watching.
8:46
I hope you have a great day.
0:00
Summer is gone, the nights are closing in,
0:02
the leaves are turning.
0:03
It must be time for the Pumpkin Spice Latte.
0:06
And it is.
0:07
And today we're gonna make the ultimate Pumpkin Spice Latte,
0:09
but to start with, I'm gonna benchmark.
0:11
I'm gonna get to Starbucks and buy one.
0:14
Success.
0:18
So we're down at Tower Bridge because this is where
0:19
the nicest Starbucks in London is
0:21
and it seemed the best place to go and get one of these.
0:24
And let's have a taste.
0:26
Ginger, a little bit of cinnamon.
0:28
The other spices are way down, very sweet, incredibly sweet.
0:32
Technically some pumpkin is in the Pumpkin Spice Latte
0:35
for reasons I don't truly understand.
0:37
So now I wanna make my own ultimate version of this.
0:41
If we're gonna put pumpkin in this,
0:43
well we should work out which pumpkin we should put in it.
0:45
So we're gonna go to Borough Market,
0:47
try and buy a bunch of pumpkins
0:49
and then head back to the studio and start cooking it up.
0:53
(upbeat music)
1:17
Let's start with pumpkins.
1:18
And I know that's kind of weird
1:19
because I'm pretty sure Pumpkin Spice Lattes started
1:24
without pumpkin in them.
1:25
They were just like a Cafe Latte
1:27
with the spice mix that people use for Pumpkin Pie.
1:30
And that's a classic spice mix
1:32
that we're gonna touch on in a minute.
1:33
But at some point people started
1:35
putting pumpkin in the drink.
1:37
Stop, stop, stop, stop stop.
1:40
What I was doing I think was all wrong.
1:42
Let me explain.
1:44
The original idea of the video was to kind of make a sauce
1:47
that tasted just like Pumpkin Pie.
1:48
This is really popular approach online.
1:50
And ultimately, I don't think
1:52
that's the right approach for me.
1:54
You know, I wanted to find the perfect pumpkin
1:56
taste a bunch of different ones,
1:58
use that to create a Pumpkin Puree,
1:59
but by the time I was sieving out my blended Pumpkin Puree,
2:04
I just wasn't happy.
2:06
I felt like I was complicating other people's work
2:08
and there had to be a different, a fresh approach.
2:11
Now this whole thing had started
2:12
when I'd gone to the website,
2:13
I looked at Starbucks' ingredients
2:15
for their Pumpkin Spice Sauce.
2:18
And you can see things like Pumpkin Puree
2:20
or condensed milk in there,
2:21
but I was haunted by this.
2:24
A little sample of the syrup
2:27
that they had given me in Starbucks.
2:29
This, aside from being a tremendous color,
2:32
well, it doesn't have Pumpkin Puree in it.
2:34
It's a clear sauce.
2:34
It doesn't have condensed milk in it.
2:37
And then I realized this year, they're launching in the UK
2:39
a kind of vegan version because this, if you taste it,
2:42
it's really just like a cinnamon syrup
2:43
with a hint of a few other spices.
2:45
But I liked the idea of something that worked for everybody,
2:48
something that didn't exclude people
2:50
who don't wanna drink dairy.
2:51
Now, I do kind of love the color of that,
2:53
but I also love the color of pumpkins.
2:54
And so what I wanna do is capture
2:56
some of that color of pumpkin, but I don't want solids.
3:00
I don't want any pureed pumpkin.
3:01
I don't wanna have to cook bits of pumpkin.
3:04
None of that is interesting to me.
3:05
So what we're gonna do from the beginning
3:08
is juice a pumpkin.
3:09
What's gonna make this recipe notable,
3:11
I think, is the spice selection.
3:13
So pumpkin spice mix
3:14
is a is a pre sort of made spice mixture
3:17
you can buy much of the U.S.
3:18
that contains five different spices.
3:21
We're gonna go deep on saucing spices in just a second,
3:24
but to start with, I'm gonna take one of these pumpkin's,
3:25
I'm gonna juice it down, and that will be the beginning
3:29
of this whole thing.
3:30
Now when you're using a pumpkin,
3:31
know that you'll get about 50% yield.
3:33
If you juice 100 grams of pumpkin flesh,
3:36
you'll get about 50 grams,
3:37
a little bit less, of juice out of that.
3:40
So when you look at the recipe
3:41
and decide how much of this mixture you wanna make,
3:43
that will decide how much pumpkin you wanna start with.
3:46
You don't need one this big.
3:47
Go for something much smaller, like a little Kabocha
3:50
if you like the flavor of those a little bit more.
3:51
This Jar-head here is very big.
3:53
I'm not gonna use all of it by any stretch.
3:55
I'm gonna start with about 500 grams
3:56
of pumpkin flesh to give me about 250 grams
3:59
of pumpkin juice.
4:01
(knife chopping)
4:03
(blander buzzing)
4:09
I'm someone who thinks about things
4:11
through a lens of coffee,
4:12
so the idea that different spices should taste different
4:14
if they're grown in different places,
4:16
well, that makes total sense to me.
4:18
So I went out and I bought a ton of different spices
4:21
from different origins,
4:22
with as much traceability as I could find.
4:24
At the end of this there'll be links
4:25
to these particular spaces down below.
4:27
So the biggest component of a pumpkin spice blend
4:30
traditionally is cinnamon.
4:32
Now you can go two ways with cinnamon.
4:34
You can go down the traditional cinnamon quills route,
4:37
or you can use what's called cassia bark.
4:39
Now I wanna use both because they have two quite different
4:43
characteristics of cinnamon.
4:45
The cassia bark, in this case it's from Vietnam.
4:47
Smells amazing.
4:48
It's that kind of candy cinnamon.
4:50
It's that jelly beans cinnamon that very bright,
4:52
lively, hot, spicy cinnamon, almost cartoonish.
4:57
You know what I mean?
4:58
It's almost artificial but so, so incredibly good.
5:01
But it needs some balance.
5:03
And what I loved about these,
5:04
these are Sri Lankan cinnamon quills
5:06
is that you've got that warmer slight earthier,
5:09
slightly rounder experience of cinnamon.
5:11
They're absolutely cinnamon
5:12
but it's a totally different thing.
5:13
And by combining equal parts of these two,
5:16
we get this broad spectrum of cinnamon's taste
5:19
and aromatics that is incredibly enjoyable.
5:22
So second ingredient that's really important is ginger.
5:24
This is something I tasted quite strong
5:26
in the Starbucks drink.
5:26
Though I might've just put it there with my mind.
5:29
It's hard to find traceable ginger powder.
5:30
A lot of what I tested came from India
5:32
and that was the kind of heavier, almost earthier ginger.
5:35
This from China, I really liked.
5:37
It was a bit more aromatic, kind of zestier,
5:40
fresher, brighter, still a good bit of heat from that too,
5:43
really very enjoyable.
5:44
So that's gonna be a secondary component.
5:47
Clove is a difficult one for me.
5:49
I had an accident sort of
5:51
with a kind of super critical extract of cloves
5:53
which scarred me for life.
5:56
I find it quite challenging smell and taste
5:58
and ultimately cloves easily overwhelm everything.
6:00
So we're gonna use this extremely sparingly.
6:02
These ones are Sri Lankan.
6:04
A lot of it comes from Indonesia too
6:06
but I just slightly preferred these for Sri Lankan ones.
6:09
All of that pungency that you want from clove
6:11
but almost a little bit sweeter, which was very nice.
6:14
Now, nutmeg is one of my favorite spices
6:16
just 'cause it looks beautiful when you cut open into it.
6:19
This one is from a French company called
6:20
(speaking in French)
6:21
I think it's from Grenada and it smells amazing.
6:27
Now this in particular, you need to grind fresh
6:30
or grade fresh in many dishes
6:32
because it fades very fast, but we're coffee people.
6:34
We used to grinding stuff to order.
6:36
The last spice in the mix is allspice.
6:38
I don't know a ton about it.
6:39
I struggled to find much variety of it
6:41
and the ones that I did get
6:43
really there wasn't a huge variation
6:44
so don't stress out too much hunting
6:46
for the perfect allspice with my experience so far.
6:49
Now, like I said, we're coffee people,
6:51
we think like coffee people.
6:52
What's gonna make this whole recipe much more interesting
6:55
is that we're gonna grind our spice mix to order.
6:58
Now, maybe like me,
6:59
you've got an old blade grinder lying around
7:01
and that is completely perfect.
7:04
This is just the cheap Krups one.
7:06
I think it was like 15 Pounds.
7:08
It's what we're gonna be using today.
7:09
Everything in the grinder,
7:10
grind until it's a nice, fine powder.
7:12
May take a little while and give it a shake
7:13
now again as you go.
7:14
(grinder spinning)
7:17
Onto the next stage where we're gonna make the spiced syrup.
7:19
We're gonna take a weight of pumpkin juice here
7:23
and we're gonna add an equal amount of water.
7:25
(water pouring)
7:27
Use the same jug, it's okay.
7:29
Now the ultimate syrup, the way move forward,
7:31
is gonna be more akin to a two to one syrup.
7:33
Where it's two parts sugar, one part of water.
7:35
But to start with, we're gonna make it a one to one.
7:38
So here I've got about 450 grams of liquid.
7:40
So I'm gonna take 450 grams of Demerara sugar.
7:43
You can get something a little Browner if you want to
7:44
but I figured that's just Brown enough
7:46
to be that little bit of softening that we like
7:49
and then we gonna cook it to reduce it
7:51
until it's closer to a two to one syrup.
7:53
That cooking process will transform the flavor
7:55
of the pumpkin juice from being that kind of very fresh
7:58
but slightly vegetal-green kind of flavor
8:01
into more of a cooked flavor.
8:02
And it will be pretty muted as flavor goes
8:04
by the time it's all kind of finished
8:06
and we're gonna add to this about 20 grams
8:09
of the spice mixture
8:10
and we're gonna cook it all down together.
8:12
So onto the heat and give it a little whisk to stir
8:14
get that sugar dissolved.
8:16
(stirring mixture)
8:18
So we cooked stuff down now
8:20
but the important phase we need is a bit of separation.
8:22
I don't want any bits in my syrup.
8:25
Now I'm a bit unusual
8:27
and I have a very fine drum sieve lying around
8:29
'cause I'm a bit weird.
8:31
So I'm gonna pass it through this.
8:32
It's about 19 microns, so extremely fine
8:34
but it would be perfectly acceptable to use
8:37
something like a cheesecloth or Muslim.
8:39
(mixture pouring)
8:41
And then when strained and happy
8:43
you can transfer to your squeeze bottle.
8:46
We're good to go.
8:47
Let's make a drink.
8:48
Now, It's not entirely up to me
8:49
to tell you how much syrup to use.
8:51
I don't like things too much on the sweet side.
8:53
So in what is an eight ounces drink, I'm gonna max out.
8:56
For me at about 15 grams syrup,
8:59
but I'm just gonna mix into my espresso
9:01
before adding that a steamed milk.
9:03
(grinder grinding)
9:06
At this point you could be using a plant milk of some sort.
9:08
It depends what you like, be it old or anything else.
9:12
Having a lovely very simple little experience.
9:18
For some people maybe too sweet,
9:19
for some people not sweet enough.
9:21
The spice level is very pleasant.
9:23
It's very balanced.
9:24
Even with dairy in this particular drink,
9:27
you can get the extra layers
9:29
of complexity of kind of flavor
9:31
or at least that come with some really great spices
9:34
sourced from different parts of the world.
9:36
I would absolutely beg you go,
9:38
go and source some interesting spices from different places.
9:40
Taste the difference, it's eyeopening.
9:42
What I didn't do yet was actually do a direct comparison
9:45
between what I have here and what I have here.
9:50
That with a little taste of the Starbucks syrup.
9:51
What a color?
9:53
Kind of a very simplistic cinnamon,
9:55
very big whack of cloves,
9:57
which I've just not chasing personally.
10:00
Interesting acidity there.
10:01
I suspect that might be part of it's preservative,
10:05
you know, component there.
10:07
Let's compare it to something a little bit more
10:10
traceable, homemade, aromatic.
10:15
Worlds apart.
10:16
So much complexity, warmth, depth, breadth of flavor.
10:21
Room for each of those spices to come out.
10:24
That is very nice.
10:25
That is really nice.
10:26
'Cause this got good ingredients.
10:27
It's the lesson that coffee, I hope, teaches all of us.
10:30
Which is good ingredients
10:31
are kind of the key to everything else.
10:33
We can go further.
10:34
We should go for like a more complete build of this thing.
10:37
Now, if you're curious about any of this stuff going on here
10:40
there's links to it down below,
10:41
there's a recipe linked on a website.
10:43
A website that I built with this video sponsor.
10:45
Which is Squarespace.
10:47
When it's time for me to build a website,
10:49
I always turn to Squarespace.
10:50
It doesn't matter if it's a website for me
10:52
in a portfolio of the work that I do
10:54
or if it's for an event.
10:55
Like the world's largest coffee tasting
10:56
or a showcase for my book, "The World Atlas of Coffee".
11:00
For me it's so easy that I can start
11:01
with one of their templates and very quickly transform it
11:04
into being something that is truly my own.
11:06
My words, my images, my style.
11:08
Very quickly you can go from idea
11:09
to a beautiful representation of who you are
11:11
or what you do online.
11:14
And more than that, once that website's up,
11:16
you know, it's gonna look good across any and all browsers
11:18
and there's nothing to patch, upgrade or install.
11:20
There's no maintenance to really worry about,
11:22
but there is 24 seven email support.
11:25
I would say, don't take my word for it.
11:26
Go sign up for trial down below, build something.
11:30
And when you're ready to launch
11:31
use code JAMESHOFFMANN
11:32
for 10% of any website or any domain.
11:35
Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video.
11:38
So the last part of this drink built,
11:39
to make it the ultimate Pumpkin Spice Latte
11:41
is gonna be some Whipped Cream.
11:43
Now, maybe like me, you're kind of put off by that because
11:46
at this point we've got quite a lot of milk of some sort,
11:49
plus sugar, plus spices.
11:50
The coffee's kind of getting obliterated
11:52
by all the stuff going on here
11:54
and having a Whipped Cream on top.
11:56
Well actually that's only gonna make it worse.
11:58
So here's what we're gonna do.
11:59
We're gonna do a special coffee-infused Whipped Cream
12:02
to go on top to make it extremely delicious.
12:05
Just think about this as a Pumpkin Spice Latte
12:07
topped with a little almost coffee ice cream.
12:09
Start with, we're just gonna use 10 fluid ounces
12:12
or 280ml more sensibly of double cream.
12:15
To that we're gonna add the seeds
12:17
and half of vanilla bean pod.
12:19
You could use paste if you wanted to,
12:20
but if you have a vanilla bean pod lying around
12:22
it's very useful.
12:23
Pour it in two.
12:25
And then for Whipped Cream,
12:26
I generally like about 5% weight of sugar.
12:29
Just white sugar is totally fine.
12:31
And then we're gonna add 10 grams
12:32
of pretty costly ground coffee.
12:34
We want a nice and easy to stray out later
12:36
so don't bother going too fine,
12:38
it's gonna give up its flavor pretty quickly
12:40
and will be delicious.
12:42
Throw that on the heat gently just to warm it up
12:45
just a little bit, to get some infusion going on.
12:48
So once it's done, you're just gonna strain it out.
12:52
It's taken on some very nice color.
12:54
This is gonna go into your Whipping Siphon.
12:57
I'm gonna chill it down, charge it,
13:00
and then we're ready for the final drink build.
13:03
(Siphon whipping)
13:05
For estimate my milk would just get our syrup in.
13:09
Now when it comes to steaming the milk,
13:10
if you're gonna add whipped cream know that
13:12
your foam is still gonna be light than the Whipped Cream.
13:14
So the Whipped Cream was sink into the foam.
13:16
So you want a little foam as you can get away with
13:19
just like a nice silky texture
13:21
that you might use for a flat white or a latte.
13:23
We don't need to worry about latte out either.
13:28
And then a little dusting
13:32
of our spices.
13:34
And what we have here is an oozing and decadent treat.
13:40
There is a lovely little hit of coffee up front
13:42
from that cold-sweet vanillary coffee cream.
13:45
Then that kind of warm spiciness underneath.
13:47
It's sweet, but it's not overwhelming.
13:50
It's autumnal.
13:52
It's what you want Autumn to taste like.
13:55
A little bit messy but it's just delicious.
13:59
There it is, the ultimate Pumpkin Spice Latte.
14:01
I am very pleased with the result.
14:03
If you didn't wanna do the Whipped Cream
14:05
but a vegan version using say coconut,
14:07
do the same thing in terms of the amount of coffee
14:09
and the amount of sugar
14:10
and the amount of vanilla bean going in there.
14:12
And you'll have a very similar result.
14:13
Did it taste of pumpkin?
14:15
No, not really.
14:17
Did that count as one of my five a day still?
14:20
Probably not also.
14:21
Was it delicious, was it fun to make, was it interesting,
14:23
was it beautiful?
14:24
I think so.
14:25
And I think you should give it a go too.
14:27
I think this is so interesting to me
14:29
to look at other ingredients through the lens of coffee.
14:31
Right? To think about spices like you think about coffee
14:34
and in doing so I learned a ton.
14:36
I discovered what I like.
14:37
I discovered a whole new range of flavors
14:39
and I made an end result that while many considered trashy
14:43
I think shows a kind of taste of place.
14:45
It shows providence,
14:46
it shows some transparency in its flavors.
14:48
And I think that's kind of cool
14:49
as well as just being incredibly delicious.
14:52
But let me know your thoughts.
14:53
Let me know if you give this a try.
14:54
Let me know what you think.
14:55
Let me know if you struggle to find some spices you like.
14:57
Let me know if you do a little spice tasting
14:59
and your mind is blown like mine was.
15:02
I would love to hear from all of you
15:03
down in the comments below.
15:04
There's a link to the recipe,
15:06
to all of the ingredients down in the description.
15:08
But for now, I'll say thank you so much for watching
15:11
and I hope you have a great day.
0:00
- Today's video is the first in a new occasional series,
0:27
looking at icons of coffee, classics in the field,
0:30
things that have endured,
0:33
and I can think of nothing better to start us off with,
0:36
than the Chemex coffee maker.
0:37
Now these videos aren't so much pure technique videos,
0:40
nor are they pure product reviews.
0:41
They'll have a little bit of those in there,
0:43
along with a few other bits and pieces.
0:00
And we'll start with the history of the Chemex.
0:49
While the Chemex feels a gi-g quintessentially,
0:51
American coffee maker,
0:52
it's inventor was actually born in Germany.
0:55
Dr. Peter Schlumbohm was drawn to the US
0:58
by it's patent laws and he was an inventor
1:00
and he patented, I think over 300 different items,
1:04
though this was by far the most successful
1:06
and long lasting of them.
1:08
He patented the Chemex in 1941 and it was ultimately
1:11
released and produced in 1942 by the Chemex Corporation.
1:15
It's an incredibly simple, yet beautiful design.
1:18
It's just a single piece of glass
1:20
with a wooden collar and a tie,
1:23
and it's distinctive design means
1:24
that you might have seen it pop up
1:26
in tons of pop culture on TV and in movies.
1:29
You might have seen it in an episode of Friends.
1:34
You might have seen it in Mad Men,
1:37
or even in Interstellar.
1:40
People really love the Chemex.
1:43
They formed an emotional attachment to it as a brewer
1:46
and therefor, to the coffee that it makes, as well,
1:48
but let's talk about why some people
1:50
really don't like the Chemex, and that means,
1:52
we can look at two piece of it's design,
1:54
that I think, are distinctive and fundamental.
1:57
There are other aspects of the design to talk about,
1:59
be it the little wooden collar,
2:00
or the glass handle on the other version.
2:02
What I'm interested in looking at, initially,
2:04
is the design decision to make this a single piece of glass,
2:08
to have both brewing cone and the base, all as one thing.
2:12
That's not particularly common
2:14
and actually presents a surprising little challenge,
2:18
and the challenge is that, when you're brewing,
2:19
it wouldn't be possible, in theory,
2:21
for an airlock to happen.
2:23
If air cannot freely flow from the bottom chamber,
2:26
to be displaced by the coffee coming in,
2:28
then it'll build up a little bit of pressure
2:30
and coffee will stop flowing
2:32
from the cone into the base, below.
2:35
Now, to counteract that, there are two things here.
2:39
Firstly, you have this particular channel here,
2:41
that runs all the way down into the base,
2:43
and that's really designed, not just to pour nicely,
2:46
which thankfully it does do, but also
2:48
to allow air out of the base section during a brew.
2:51
But what can happen, is the paper
2:53
can form a perfect seal with the glass, all the way around,
2:56
and then you're in trouble, then you'll stall your brew.
3:01
Now, to counteract that,
3:03
there is the design of the Chemex papers.
3:06
So, a Chemex paper looks like this.
3:07
It's a very large piece of paper,
3:09
which is kind of a problem, but it's folded in such a way,
3:13
that when you brew, one side of you cone
3:16
is much, much, much thicker than the other side of the cone.
3:20
When you're brewing, you're really supposed
3:21
to make sure that the thick side
3:23
is where the little channel is,
3:26
where the air gap is, where the spout is.
3:28
This means that this paper is less likely
3:30
to collapse and form a seal.
3:33
The downside of this design, is that you have so much paper.
3:39
Not only, a Chemex paper is much thicker,
3:41
but having a triple ply on one side,
3:44
really does affect the way that the coffee brews.
3:46
For context, a single Chemex paper
3:48
weighs just under four and a half grams.
3:51
A single two-cup Hario paper weighs about 1.5 grams.
3:55
It's literally three times the amount of paper,
3:58
and potentially, three times the amount of paper taste,
4:00
if you don't rinse that out, and also,
4:02
three times the kind of clarifying power.
4:06
Having a lot of thick paper
4:08
will change the way that your coffee tastes.
4:09
It will taste cleaner in some ways.
4:13
You'll definitely remove a about as much suspended material,
4:16
as you possibly can, and that's,
4:18
for most people, that's a good thing.
4:20
People like a clean tasting cup of coffee.
4:23
Your filter paper will add a little bit of resistance
4:26
to the way that the coffee brews that cone.
4:29
Not only does the water have to get
4:31
through your bed of coffee,
4:32
it has to get through the paper, as well.
4:34
What I tend to see, is two things as a result.
4:37
I see people trying to grind just a little but coarser,
4:39
to get shorter brew times with the Chemex,
4:41
and as a result, having a slightly weaker brew.
4:43
I often see people, also using higher doses in a Chemex,
4:48
than they would do in, say,
4:49
a V60 or a Kalita or another brewer.
4:52
Ultimately, this is just a mechanism
4:54
of dealing with the potential th-und-er extraction.
4:56
This is not a flawed brewer,
4:58
but you do have to make some accommodations
5:00
to not get into a spiral of up-dosing and under-extracting.
5:03
We'll come onto that in just a second.
5:05
Before I get too much into the technique stuff, though,
5:08
I do wanna talk about a couple of the different options
5:10
that you have and shapes and finishes, I guess.
5:14
This, to me, this is the classic Chemex, this shape,
5:19
this size and actually this little wooden collar.
5:21
But I won't lie to you, this collar
5:23
is a terrible piece of design in may ways.
5:26
It's a incredibly frustrating to use.
5:28
To tie and untie this thing, it's not good,
5:31
it's not fun, it's annoying.
5:33
To have to take it off to put into the dishwasher
5:36
or to clean it properly, is annoying
5:38
and I don't think the wood ages particularly well,
5:40
but, as I just look at it, I think it looks beautiful.
5:44
I really like the wood-collar look,
5:46
and I think it photographs well, it just looks great.
5:50
But, the alternative is popular with a lot of people,
5:53
which is this one,
5:54
and this is the one that doesn't have the wood collar
5:57
and it just has the glass handle, so you'd have something,
5:59
not hot to hold when you're doing it.
6:01
Now, I'm not saying that this is ugly
6:03
or hideous or it doesn't look good.
6:05
It's more practical, despite the fact that,
6:07
in theory, it's more breakable,
6:09
but it just doesn't look,
6:11
it just doesn't look as good, as the original Chemex.
6:14
Now, there is another chape.
6:15
There's the smaller shape.
6:17
I would say, probably don't bother with it.
6:20
I don't particularly like
6:21
that sort of steeply-angled brewing dynamic,
6:24
but I also don't think it has the proportions
6:27
and the, just, aesthetic loveliness
6:30
of the original shape and size.
6:33
Let's talk about technique.
6:34
Let's talk about how I might recommend
6:35
that you change your brewing technique,
6:37
specifically for the Chemex.
6:39
Now, a lot of this is based
6:40
on the V60 technique that I put out there,
6:42
if you haven't seen that, there's a link up here.
6:44
I'd recommend watching that,
6:46
but before watching this, 'cause it'll make more sense.
6:49
But, let's talk about this thing, here.
6:51
Now, I'm gonna say it, we're gonna keep our dose
6:53
at 60 grams per liter, I certainly enjoy that.
6:55
If you like stronger coffee, feel free to change that.
7:00
Now, one of the key things here,
7:01
is to not try to compensate too much
7:05
for the additional resistance that the paper adds.
7:07
In a simple experiment, we brewed a Chemex next to a V60,
7:12
with the same grind setting.
7:14
Same dose, same pouring technique,
7:17
and the brew from the Chemex
7:18
just took much, much, much longer.
7:21
That's okay.
7:23
You don't have to compensate
7:25
and grind much coarser for the Chemex,
7:26
to get that three, three-and-a-half-minute brew time.
7:29
You're gonna have four to five minute brew times,
7:33
brewing half a liter with the Chemex,
7:34
and you're gonna have great-tasting coffee.
7:37
In terms of the bloom, I would do
7:39
exactly the same, as I do in the V60.
7:41
Two to one, to three to one,
7:42
in terms of bloom water to coffee dose,
7:45
so, 60 grams of bloom to 90 grams of bloom,
7:48
if you're brewing 30 grams of coffee,
7:50
and let that bloom for at least 45 seconds.
7:54
I would say, a similar pouring technique,
7:56
in terms of phases to the V60 video, and at the end,
7:59
you're gonna do the same things
8:00
with a little stir and then a swirl,
8:02
to help the draw down and have a flat bed.
8:05
There is one more little hack that I have seen,
8:07
that is actually useful to have in your reserves.
8:10
Now, I talked about the issue before,
8:11
of what happens if you're paper perfectly adheres
8:14
and sticks to the glass all the way around,
8:17
and you get that airlock.
8:18
What I have seen people do,
8:20
is use something like a chopstick,
8:23
and having a chopstick in the brewer seems a little weird,
8:26
but it does help prevent the paper,
8:28
perfectly sticking to the glass.
8:30
It will always leave air a space to get out,
8:33
and it will not cause your brew to stall,
8:36
but, know that you are sticking
8:38
a piece of wood in your coffee.
8:39
Now, you could go, visit my, like a Korean chopstick,
8:42
which is made out of stainless steel, which is great,
8:44
or a high-quality chopstick, it'll probably be okay,
8:46
but maybe not a cheap disposable one.
8:49
Better still, really, is just to be mindful
8:52
of this gap, of this spout.
8:53
Pay attention to it, make sure it doesn't close,
8:56
after you've rinsed your paper,
8:57
and do make sure you rinse your papers, the Chemex papers.
9:00
Just make sure that it's tight across that gap,
9:03
and it isn't beginning to fold into it.
9:06
That's really important.
9:07
I'll say one more quick thing about the Chemex.
9:09
One more thing, that for me, just elevates it a little bit.
0:00
Coffee looks beautiful in a Chemex.
9:17
The way that the light shines through coffee in a Chemex,
9:21
it is just a little bit special,
9:24
and it took me a little while to work out,
9:25
why it's like this with the Chemex
9:27
and not so much with another brewer, and I actually think,
9:30
it's to do with this little base piece of the design, here.
9:33
It just catches the light differently,
9:36
to say, a drip decanter,
9:37
and just brings a little bit more color
9:39
and hey, we even drink with our eyes, too.
9:42
Coffee never looks more vibrant,
9:44
more red, more beautiful, more delicious,
9:46
than it does in a Chemex, and that matters to me.
9:49
But I'd love to hear your stories about the Chemex.
9:52
Tell me about how it fits into your life.
9:54
Tell me why you live it.
9:56
Tell me why you hate it.
9:57
I'd really love to hear from you.
9:58
Do you have little tips and tricks and hacks,
10:00
that you wanna share with the audience?
10:02
We would love to hear them.
10:05
I'm gonna say, thank you so much for watching,
10:07
and I hope you have a great day.

Welcome to this video all about the AeroPress.
0:22
Now on this channel, we run a little series.
0:25
It's called the Classics of Coffee.
0:26
We look at iconic coffee brewers,
0:28
their invention, their history,
0:29
how they came to be so popular worldwide.
0:32
This is an unusual inclusion.
0:34
It's relatively young
0:35
compared to most of the other subjects we might look at.
0:36
It was invented and released only in 2005,
0:40
but it has come to be a global phenomenon.
0:43
It's everywhere around the world.
0:44
It's hugely successful.
0:45
And we should look at why.
0:47
Now it was invented, as I said, in 2005, by Alan Adler.
0:51
Now, Alan is a serial inventor
0:53
and his passion really started with sailboats.
0:56
He loved sailboats, he wanted to design them,
0:58
and so he needed to understand aerodynamics.
1:00
That led him all the way to inventing
1:03
the Aerobie Flying Ring.
1:04
Released in 1985, it's still a classic today.
1:07
I still have one at home,
1:09
I still throw them around now and again.
1:10
And within a year of its release,
1:12
it had made the Guinness Book of World Records
1:14
for the furthest object thrown by human hand,
1:16
at that time about 320 meters,
1:18
has since gone to around 400 meters,
1:20
which is a very long way to throw something.
1:22
Now the AeroPress came much later.
1:24
It came out of Alan's frustration
1:26
with not being able to get a good single cup
1:29
out of a small domestic coffee brewer.
1:31
You know, those things were typically designed
1:33
to brew maybe six to eight cups,
1:34
and no matter what he did,
1:36
he could not get a single serving out of one
1:38
that tasted good.
1:39
That frustration
1:40
led to the invention of this, the AeroPress.
1:43
As I said, it was released in 2005,
1:46
but it didn't really find popularity until more like 2008.
1:50
And I think some context is really, really important here
1:52
from the wider specialty coffee industry.
1:54
There had been a company who'd created a machine
1:57
called the Clover.
1:58
Now this was very influential, 2006, 2007
2:01
because it encouraged cafes
2:02
to brew different coffees by the cup.
2:04
And so the coffee industry got excited
2:06
about what seems normal now.
2:08
Like, offering a cup of this coffee from Brazil
2:10
or a cup of this coffee from Columbia,
2:12
side-by-side on a menu.
2:13
Before this, batch brew had really ruled
2:15
and that was the kind of choice,
2:17
you might have one or two things.
2:18
But now cafes around the world
2:20
were embracing brewing by the cup
2:22
and offering a diverse menu of coffees.
2:24
In 2008, Clover was sold to Starbucks.
2:28
And while the industry as a whole
2:29
might've felt a little betrayed by the sale,
2:31
they had found a love for single-cup brewing,
2:34
but no longer could use this machine.
2:36
And so they began to look for other single-cup brewers.
2:38
Around this time you see things like the Hario V60
2:41
explode in popularity, as well as the AeroPress.
0:00
Now you've probably noticed
4:06
that the brew temperature used for this
4:07
is different from what most people recommend.
4:09
80 degrees C is a lot lower
4:11
than I would typically say to brew your coffee.
4:14
Alan, the inventor, really truly believes this is key
4:17
to getting great coffee out of the AeroPress
4:19
and he has fought tooth and nail for that
4:21
since its inception.
4:23
I think it's interesting,
4:24
but I really don't believe it's an essential part
4:26
of getting great coffee out of this thing.
4:27
Now, according to the instructions,
4:28
you can drink this as is, espresso style,
4:31
though there's a lot of debate
4:33
about whether this can really be called espresso style.
4:35
It's a small, strong coffee,
4:36
but we'll not go down that rabbit hole right now.
4:38
You could obviously dilute this,
4:39
which is what I'm gonna do,
4:40
to make an Americano-style drink,
4:42
or more like a drip-strength drink.
4:44
Let me do that.
4:46
Now one thing I love about the instructions
0:00
Welcome to Understanding The AeroPress.
0:02
This is gonna be a big, giant dive into the AeroPress,
0:04
and how to brew with the AeroPress.
0:06
Here's how it's gonna work.
0:08
We're gonna look at all of the individual variables
0:10
around AeroPress brewing.
0:11
One of the delights of this brewer
0:13
is that you can isolate your variables
0:15
and play with them a little bit more.
0:17
So that's what we're gonna do.
0:18
We're gonna ask and answer a bunch of questions.
0:20
Now, I will make sure that each individual experiment
0:22
is timestamped down below.
0:24
If you want to jump to that,
0:25
if you wanna go back to a particular experiment
0:27
and see more about it.
0:28
I'm going to use my trusty refractometer,
0:30
my fancy cupping spoon.
0:32
And hopefully we're gonna learn
0:33
some really interesting things today.
0:34
So brew a cup of coffee, maybe not a big cup,
0:37
cause you might wanna brew another one
0:38
at the end of this.
0:39
Two notes before we begin:
0:40
Firstly, where we're doing extraction and measurement,
0:43
I don't want you to really worry or look at the numbers.
0:45
They are, you know, correlated to the coffee being used,
0:48
the grinder being used,
0:49
which is not the same as what you're using.
0:50
What we're interested in is trends.
0:52
Like what does a change do to extraction, broadly speaking?
0:56
So we're not gonna obsess over numbers.
0:57
And secondly, there's a mixture of tastings here.
1:00
Some are kinda performative tastings
1:02
where I've done the experiments a lot before.
1:04
And a few of these will actually be me
1:05
tasting these experiments for the first time.
1:07
Those kinds of tests will be blind
1:09
while the other ones won't necessarily be blind.
1:12
Hope that makes sense.
0:00
Time for experiment one.
1:17
The most obvious of them, I suppose.
1:18
Which is how long should I steep my AeroPress for?
1:21
And the way we're gonna look at it is this.
1:23
I'm gonna take a standard technique.
1:25
I'm gonna brew 12 grams to 200 grams of water.
1:27
I'm gonna pour all the water in one go.
1:30
We're gonna use the plunger
1:31
to create a little vacuum on top,
1:33
to hold the brewer as it steeps.
1:35
And we'll give it a stir at the end of the steep time,
1:37
and we'll gently press.
1:38
We will do this with six different brew times.
1:41
With 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds,
1:44
120 seconds, 240 seconds and 480 seconds,
1:49
same grind for all of them.
1:51
And we'll be able to see how extraction
1:53
is changed by immersion time.
1:55
Of course, this isn't unique to AeroPress brewing,
1:57
but it is one of the big questions,
1:58
where am I diminishing returns and brew time?
2:01
So let's answer that now.
2:03
So here we've got our six brews
2:04
from that experiment going from 30 seconds
2:06
up to four minutes in time.
2:08
And if we look at the data,
2:10
unsurprisingly we see a rapid increase
2:12
in extraction early on
2:13
beginning to flatten out towards this end here.
2:16
And from a taste perspective,
2:19
that's not very nice.
2:20
It's not bad.
2:21
It's just not very nice.
2:22
Better, a little bit more texture, a bit more body.
2:24
And as we get to this point,
2:26
certainly by here, things are tasting pretty good.
2:29
And I would argue for this particular grind setting,
2:32
we're hitting a point of diminishing returns
2:34
between two and four minutes.
2:36
As we get from two minutes to four minutes,
2:37
there is that little bump in quality.
2:39
I think it does get a little bit sweeter
2:41
in this particular, simple test,
2:43
but certainly in a cafe environment,
2:46
I'm not sure that I'd be willing to put the extra time in,
2:50
especially because, you know,
2:51
no one would be tasting these two side by side
2:53
and picking and choosing. On its own,
2:55
this is a nice cup. At eight minutes, it's very nice still.
2:58
Again, we doubled our brew time from here to here.
3:01
I'm not sure we've seen,
3:03
really, a good return on our investment.
3:06
You know, it's a tiny bit better,
3:08
but not really much in this situation.
3:10
For me for this grind setting,
3:12
I'd be looking at a two-minute brew.
3:13
Now, you might argue
3:15
well, what about different grind settings?
3:16
And that's a good point.
3:17
If you look at the same experiment
3:19
done, say, a coarser grind
3:20
you'll see that the coarser you grind,
3:22
the sort of the lower your maximum extraction is gonna be,
3:25
because you have less surface area,
3:27
and the slower that extraction is.
3:29
Okay, well, then the ideal therefore is to go
3:31
as fine as possible and brew as fast as possible,
3:33
then that's the most efficient thing, right?
3:34
Well, maybe, but maybe not.
3:37
Something we will touch on a little bit later on.
3:40
On now to our next experiment.
0:00
So this test, relatively simple actually.
3:46
You'll notice in the previous brew,
3:47
before we plunged, we gave it a little stir.
3:50
Well, what's actually happening there?
3:52
Is there a big kick in extraction when we stir?
3:54
How much of a difference does that make?
3:56
So we'll do a side-by-side
3:57
with a couple of different grind settings.
3:59
Doing essentially that same recipe
4:00
with a stir and with no stir,
4:02
just to see how that process,
4:05
how that little addition impacts extraction and flavour.
4:08
So here's our test brewed.
4:10
Our coarser set here, no stir and stir,
4:12
and our finer grounds set here, no stir and stir.
4:15
Starting at the courser set,
4:16
really interesting difference here.
4:17
The stir has made a massive difference, actually.
4:20
This cup is incredibly weak and empty
4:23
and boring and hollow and dull,
4:25
and has been improved quite a lot by a stir.
4:27
So it's definitely bumped up the extraction quite a lot,
4:30
and actually when it came to looking at the numbers,
4:32
a lot, a shocking amount here.
4:35
However, where we've gone finer to start with,
4:38
and we were already operating
4:39
at a sort of close to the ceiling level of extraction
4:41
because we're grinding much finer extractions
4:43
happening much quicker,
4:44
the stir, well, a different story.
4:47
Yes, there is an incremental increase in extraction
4:49
with the stir, but it's not huge, right?
4:52
Because we've already done a good job extracting
4:54
by having a finer grind,
4:56
that stir didn't make as big of a difference
4:58
as it did over here,
4:59
where we'd done a much worse job extracting
5:01
with the coarser grind setting, super interesting.
5:03
It would be one where if I had a coarser grind,
5:06
and I was stuck with it,
5:07
then I'd be thinking a lot more about using this,
5:09
and making sure that I was stirring adequately
5:11
to get those extraction numbers up.
5:12
Whereas with a fine grind,
5:14
I'd be worrying a little less
5:15
and certainly not being too aggressive with it,
5:17
you know, just a gentle stir I think is plenty.
5:00
Now, in the theme of stirring,
5:24
one thing I now wanna check is,
5:25
is is there any difference between stirring and swirling?
5:28
You know from my V60 technique
5:30
that I really like to swirl that kind of movement
5:32
that is kind of uniform in its action on all the coffee,
5:34
whereas, you know, stirring is typically
5:36
more localized around the spoon.
5:38
In a V60, a bigger deal,
5:39
in a small AeroPress, maybe not as much.
5:40
So we'll do a swirl versus stir test two times
5:43
just like this with the finer setting
5:44
and the coarser setting.
5:46
See if there's really any difference,
5:47
whether it's stirred or swirled.
5:49
An interesting test. I think with the coarser set,
5:51
once again, you sort of see the impact of the difference
5:54
more than you do where the set is ground kind of finer,
5:56
at the sort of finer end of things.
5:58
Here, there's quite a noticeable difference
6:00
between the two cups,
6:01
and there's definitely a little bump
6:02
in extraction with the swirl.
6:04
And I do prefer the swirl,
6:06
just for that little extra richness to the cup.
6:08
Now, this is obviously not the first time
6:09
I've done these tests.
6:10
I've historically preferred swirling over stirring
6:13
from blind testing through measurement,
6:14
all that kind of stuff.
6:15
And the same, broadly, is true here.
6:18
There's not much in it,
6:19
at the finer ground setting, there really isn't
6:21
but there's a little kind of
6:22
extra kick of sweetness and uniformity in that one
6:25
that isn't there in this, it's a little bit muddier and
6:27
harsher compared to that one there.
6:29
It's a single brew.
6:30
But I think it's a good demonstration
6:33
of a broader effect.
6:34
So my preference has always been for swirling
6:36
though at finer settings,
6:38
I don't think it matters that much.
0:00
Next up is a test
6:42
that will involve some blind testing for me.
6:43
So new territory, which is kind of interesting,
6:45
and that is testing the bloom.
6:47
Blooming is very common in pour over brewing,
6:49
where you add a little bit of hot water
6:50
to the grounds and let them sort of steep,
6:52
let them degas a little bit
6:53
so that you have a higher chance
6:54
of an even extraction afterwards.
6:56
Get rid of that CO2 that's in the grounds
6:58
that can be a bit of a troublemaker.
7:00
Typically, this isn't done in immersion brewing,
7:02
but it is done by some people in AeroPress brewing.
7:05
Here's the test.
7:06
We're gonna brew two AeroPresses side-by-side.
7:08
One will have a bloom for about 30 seconds
7:11
and then an additional 1 minute 30 of steeping.
7:13
And the other one we'll just have a two minutes steep,
7:15
and they'll be brewed otherwise identically.
7:18
We'll do that twice,
7:19
with the same grind setting, actually,
7:20
to really dig into this.
7:21
And then they'll be put into a blind triangle tasting for me
7:24
while I'll have to pick the odd one,
7:26
out of three bowls each time.
7:28
If you're not familiar with triangle tests,
7:30
they are a better than an AB,
7:31
because I have to, you know, get one in three right twice
7:34
instead of 50/50 twice.
7:35
So the odds of me being accidentally correct are much lower.
7:40
You can do two out of fives.
7:41
Those are - or three out of fives,
7:42
those are tougher still.
7:44
But triangles I think are enough for today.
7:46
So firstly, can I pick the odd one out?
7:49
This is really tough.
7:50
I'll say right now, if I get these right,
7:51
it'll be interesting.
7:52
But the differences are really quite tiny between the two.
7:56
I oddly feel more confident with this set,
7:57
I feel like I definitely don't like this.
8:01
If it's the odd one out, will be good.
8:02
This set is more difficult,
8:03
which is why it's always good to replicate this.
8:05
Even one triangle test on its own, isn't good enough.
8:07
Two is a barest of minimums.
8:09
There should be three or four
8:10
or more and more people doing them.
8:12
No, can't.
8:14
So, which was the odd one out here?
8:16
This one, honestly, they taste the same.
8:20
So this one has no bloom.
8:23
It tastes indistinguishable from the ones that are bloomed.
8:26
I can't tell them apart.
8:28
This, I'll be interested if I got this one wrong.
8:30
I've got this one right.
8:31
Interesting, it was a more pronounced difference here.
8:32
So this is a bloom and I felt more confident about this.
8:35
And this is the no bloom.
8:37
I liked this less.
8:38
It just feels a touch harsher and more extracted.
8:40
I don't really know why, it just is.
8:43
From this though,
8:44
I would say that that blooming
8:45
doesn't have a staggering impact.
8:47
If you're steeping for long enough,
8:49
that's gonna do the work.
8:51
The infusion is gonna do the work.
8:53
I'd be shocked, and we'll test it,
8:54
I'll be shocked if these have much of a difference
8:56
in their extractions, they all taste really pretty close.
9:01
Another blind test for me.
9:03
And this one probably falls under
9:04
the kind of received wisdom thing for me.
9:06
It's the topic of,
9:07
do you press to the hiss or through the hiss
9:09
on an AeroPress?
9:10
If you don't know what I'm talking about,
9:12
maybe you haven't brewed a lot of AeroPresses.
9:14
Now, many people say,
9:15
don't keep pressing
9:16
once you start to hear the hissing noise,
9:17
once you press the liquid through,
9:19
don't press that last little bit of air through
9:21
cause it makes the AeroPress taste worse.
9:23
I don't know if that's true.
9:24
So we're gonna find out.
9:25
We'll do the same thing we did last time,
9:26
which is four brews, two pairs,
9:28
same grind setting across both triangle tests
9:31
and see how I fare, picking out hiss versus no hiss.
9:35
Now, this is blind as before.
9:36
I don't know what's what in these bowls.
9:38
But what I do know that is kind of interesting,
9:39
is that the yield difference
9:41
was pretty small between the two.
9:42
So if you measure the output of liquid weight
9:44
between hiss and no hiss,
9:46
you got six grams more with the hiss, right?
9:48
So six grams more to about 180 grams of liquid.
9:52
That six grams would have to taste really terrible
9:55
to truly impact the flavour, surely.
9:57
Well, maybe it does.
9:58
Let's find out.
9:59
Does it make a big difference?
10:00
Let's say this is the odd one out.
10:02
And I would say, theoretically, that's the hiss.
10:04
It's a touch, harsher, really difficult.
10:07
Again, first set, really super hard.
10:10
And these are a little cooler.
10:13
I can't tell the difference here, I just can't.
10:15
This is a random choice.
10:17
So if I get it right, which I don't think I will,
10:20
then know that it's random,
10:21
that I didn't earn it as a success.
10:23
I'm going to say you.
10:25
As the odd one out, but I don't know.
10:26
Is it right?
10:28
No, no it's not right,
10:30
couldn't get it right.
10:30
Which one is it?
10:32
It's not you, it's you!
10:35
So that one was the hiss.
10:38
And I couldn't tell. Couldn't tell at all.
10:40
Here, I didn't get it right either.
10:42
So we can say with some confidence
10:44
that the hiss, no hiss thing, I don't think it's a thing.
10:47
It's six grams of liquid that I don't think tastes that bad.
10:50
I think this is AeroPress superstition.
10:53
I'd love you to prove me wrong.
10:55
Let's move on.
10:57
Now, next up is a topic
10:59
that you could argue is true of all coffee brewing,
11:01
but I think it's particularly relevant to the AeroPress.
11:03
And that's dose and ratio in a way.
11:06
Now, a lot of people say to brew two cups with AeroPress,
11:08
what you should do is put twice as much coffee in
11:11
and then dilute the brew afterwards.
11:13
What I want to do is a quick experiment
11:15
to show the impact of changing your dose
11:17
while keeping the amount of water
11:18
that you're brewing consistent.
11:19
How does that impact extraction?
11:21
So in this brewer I'll put 12 grams,
11:23
in this one I'll put 18 grams,
11:24
and in this one I'll put 24 grams,
11:26
we'll brew three identical brews,
11:28
200 grams of water in each one,
11:29
same brew time, same process,
11:31
and we'll taste to compare the output.
11:33
So we've got our three brews done.
11:34
12 grams, 18 grams, 24 grams,
11:36
200 grams of water each time.
11:38
This bowl as a result has less liquid in it,
11:40
because coffee retains water in the brewing process.
11:42
So having more coffee means less liquid output.
11:46
Now, having measured them,
11:47
this has sort of demonstrated a classic principle
11:50
of coffee brewing and why ratio is so, so, so important.
11:53
If you change your ratio,
11:54
you change the dynamics of extraction.
11:56
This bowl is more extracted than this bowl
11:58
which is more extracted than this bowl,
11:59
because there is more water
12:01
to do the work per gram of coffee.
12:03
That's the deal.
12:04
Now, in the AeroPress,
12:05
it's very common to say double up your dose
12:07
and dilute it down later.
12:09
This would make a very different cup
12:11
once diluted than this.
12:13
It's a less extracted cup, a less complex cup,
12:15
a more acidic cup.
12:16
So you would have to work harder in your extraction
12:19
to make this work.
12:21
Not saying it can't be done,
12:22
but you would need to adapt.
12:23
So you need to grind, finer,
12:24
even though it's an immersion brew.
12:26
And you would need to potentially steep for longer
12:29
or agitate more, you know,
12:31
you're going to have to do a bit more work
12:32
to get the extraction where you want it to be.
12:34
And this cup tastes nice and clean and balanced.
12:37
This cup, you can tell,
12:38
like there's a kicker of intensity and acidity.
12:41
You know, it's getting close to 2% strength,
12:43
which in filter coffee is really quite strong.
12:45
This, as it is right now, undrinkable,
12:47
really dominant acidities
12:48
and quite woody flavours coming out of nowhere.
12:51
Just not a very good brew, fundamentally.
12:54
And so it's worth bearing in mind,
12:56
if you're looking to adapt the AeroPress
12:58
to try and get more liquid out of it,
12:59
that you are gonna have
13:00
to totally change your brewing dynamic
13:02
using the lessons that we're learning here today.
13:06
So now I need to talk about one of the big branches
13:08
of the decision tree of AeroPress brewing.
13:10
And that is the inverted method.
13:12
The idea with the inverted method
13:13
is to have the plunger and the base,
13:15
and you brew with your coffee and water in here.
13:17
They can't go anywhere, no liquid can drip through.
13:19
At the end of the brew, put your top on,
13:22
flip it over onto your cup
13:23
and you press as normal, pretty simple.
13:26
Couple of drawbacks.
13:27
Firstly, you lose some volume in the AeroPress brew.
13:30
By having the piston on the bottom here,
13:32
you actually have a smaller brewing chamber.
13:34
So I'm gonna brew as before,
13:35
only 200 mls of liquid,
13:36
but bigger brews just will not work,
13:39
and often smaller brews are preferred.
13:40
You need the plunger a decent distance in,
13:42
because at some point you're gonna flip this thing over.
13:45
And when you do that,
13:46
the last thing you want
13:47
is for this plunger to pop out,
13:50
because in that process, coffee goes everywhere.
13:52
It's a hot mess, quite literally.
13:54
It's the process of agitation
13:56
that causes a rapid degassing of coffee,
13:58
that creates a bit of pressure inside here
13:59
that pops this top off.
14:01
So it's that motion of turning that often does it.
14:04
That initial kind of movement,
14:06
things can go horribly wrong.
14:07
So do, if you do this,
14:08
make sure your plunger
14:10
is reasonably well seated inside the AeroPress.
14:13
Now, I'm gonna brew three brews here.
14:15
For reference, we'll do one where we don't do anything.
14:18
We just put the coffee and water in,
14:20
see how much goes through,
14:21
see how badly it damages our extraction.
14:23
I'm gonna brew a regular method using the sort of plunger,
14:26
holding a sort of vacuum pressure in the top
14:28
to stop liquid dripping through.
14:29
I'm gonna brew an inverted method
14:30
and see if there's really any benefit
14:33
to the inverted method.
14:34
So we've got the three brews here.
14:35
We've got the nothing at all.
14:36
We just let it sort of drain through,
14:37
though not that much went through, that was interesting.
14:39
We've got the one with the vacuum held on top
14:41
by the plunger being in,
14:42
and then we've got the inverted method here.
14:44
We've pulled the TDS data and it's...
14:47
let's just say incredibly similar across the board,
14:49
which is quite surprising.
14:50
So time for a taste test.
14:51
Let's do this one, let's do this one kind of blind.
14:53
So I'm gonna step away.
14:54
We're gonna mix these up,
14:55
and we'll see if I have any real preferences
14:56
or if any of them have big, strong taste differences.
14:59
So I know. This one is a little bit hollow
15:01
compared to the first two.
15:03
It's just lacking a certain something in terms of sweetness.
15:06
So my guess would be,
15:07
this would be the one
15:08
where we just sort of let it drain through
15:09
and we didn't hold it.
15:11
That all the water be in contact with all the coffee
15:13
for as long as possible.
15:13
These two, more difficult, very similar.
15:15
I don't have a preference
15:16
between either of these two personally.
15:20
I think they're both very good.
15:21
I'm not sure I can, you know,
15:23
say inverted tastes better than vacuum
15:26
in the top or vice versa.
15:27
Let's find out.
15:28
This is the N for no, nothing.
15:30
That was indeed the one I thought it was.
15:32
That one is I think the inverted.
15:37
And that one, the vacuum version.
15:38
I would say I don't taste a benefit
15:40
in doing the inverted method,
15:41
that's my sort of summary here.
15:43
And historically that's why
15:44
I don't really like the inverted method.
15:45
I don't think there's really a win there.
15:47
You added a lot of risk of hurting yourself,
15:50
making a terrible mess,
15:51
and you lose some capacity of your brewer.
15:52
I don't think you gain much in return.
15:54
And from a, you know, relatively blind tasting,
15:57
I can't tell them apart.
15:58
The extraction numbers are pretty much identical.
16:01
I think it's just an extra step,
16:03
that's maybe not necessary.
16:05
Time now for a very interesting topic.
16:07
And you might've noticed
16:08
that one of the AeroPress I've been using
16:09
looks a little bit funny,
16:11
something strange is inside it.
16:13
Lemme tell you what's going on.
16:16
So this plunger, as you can see, has something inside.
16:19
I asked Gábor, who makes the Smart Espresso Profiler,
16:22
if he could adapt the plunger of an AeroPress,
16:24
and he could.
16:25
So you can see here,
16:26
the little mesh in the piston here,
16:29
and then there's a little tube
16:30
that connects it to a smart espresso profiler.
16:32
This will allow me to see, track, record, monitor,
16:37
control the pressure inside an AeroPress when I'm pressing,
16:41
which I just think is super cool.
16:43
So this connects via Bluetooth to my phone,
16:45
and I will have on my phone a little gauge
16:49
and also a graph showing me what's going on.
16:51
Kind of amazing.
16:52
And why would I wanna know?
16:53
Why does pressing matter?
16:55
That is a great question.
16:56
We know from the world of espresso,
16:57
that pressure can be good,
16:58
but pressure can cause problems in the form of channeling.
17:02
If you have a lot of pressure
17:03
and you have a weak point in your coffee bed,
17:05
pressure will exploit that
17:06
and more liquid will flow through a smaller area,
17:09
that will taste bad.
17:11
Now, what we see in Espresso grinding,
17:13
is that as you increase pressure,
17:15
your yield kind of increases and your flow increases,
17:18
and at some point you hit a wall
17:19
and you get so much channeling that your yield drops,
17:21
even though you're grinding finer.
17:23
And so for any grind setting,
17:24
there'll be a kind of peak pressure
17:26
before you sort of cause channeling.
17:28
Now, I don't know if channeling happens in AeroPresses,
17:30
but I think we should find out.
17:32
Now, the pressures are much smaller.
17:34
For a human being to generate a lot of pressure
17:36
inside an AeroPress is quite difficult.
17:38
I've really not gotten much past one and a half bars
17:41
of throwing all my weight on this thing.
17:43
Let's not brew like that.
17:44
No one brews like that.
17:46
We're going to be probably working
17:47
in the range of maybe half a bar of pressure
17:49
for a kind of normal pressing of an AeroPress.
17:51
Now, interestingly, Alan, the inventor of the AeroPress
17:54
is very against pressing hard.
17:55
He wants a nice gentle press.
17:57
He feels that a higher pressure compacts the bed,
17:59
and that's a problem.
18:00
I wonder if it causes channeling.
18:01
He might be right.
18:03
Is there a limit to how hard we can press?
18:05
What I'll do first of all,
18:07
is a series of pretty simple brews.
18:09
I'll brew at ever increasing pressures
18:11
to see if we suddenly see a decrease in extraction
18:13
that might be caused by channeling,
18:15
but that would give me an idea of how hard might be
18:18
too hard to press.
18:20
So I'll do my best.
18:21
It's quite tricky to do it manually,
18:23
but I started maybe 0.1 bar kind of 0.3, 0.6,
18:27
try one bar, see how we do.
18:29
We use the same grind, same recipe, same everything else.
18:31
And let's test the results.
18:34
So we've got our four brews here.
18:35
Starting over, actually on this side
18:37
with the sort of gentlest pressure going up and up and up.
18:39
Now, the reason this isn't blind
18:41
is because it really can't be blind.
18:43
If you look at the color of these bowls
18:45
they're all dramatically different.
18:46
What's happened here basically,
18:48
is that the harder we've pressed,
18:49
the more material has sort of
18:51
made it through the AeroPress paper.
18:53
The AeroPress paper is very small, very thin.
18:55
And I think at certain pressures,
18:56
you just blow stuff through it.
18:57
And that's what we see here.
18:58
A ton of suspended material.
19:00
It looks like a much lighter brew.
19:02
It's extraction level is lower.
19:04
We'll talk about that in a second.
19:05
But not as low as it looks.
19:07
So we knew there was suspended material here.
19:09
We made sure we use these,
19:10
these little paper filters
19:11
that sort of filter out particulate
19:13
before you refract it and give you accurate readings.
19:16
No point doing a blind tasting,
19:17
because it's literally can't be blind
19:19
because the color is so obvious
19:21
to just show me which bowl is which.
19:22
Taste-wise, lower pressure: yummy, very nice,
19:27
I'm very happy with that.
19:28
Slightly higher pressure,
19:30
really not much has changed.
19:31
It's a tiny, tiny bit, maybe more astringent,
19:35
but confirmation bias, all that kind of stuff.
19:37
It's not a blind tasting, so don't worry too much.
19:39
But it's basically a nice cup of coffee.
19:41
Here, where we got up to a sort of 0.7 bars.
19:43
I started to press with a bit of force,
19:46
no, really quite hollow,
19:49
suddenly really harsh,
19:50
really no sweetness.
19:51
This tastes like an uneven brew.
19:53
And I think that is what's happening at higher pressures.
19:55
We are not having even extraction
19:57
through that cake of coffee at the bottom of the puck.
19:59
Let's try 1.4 bars of pressure at peak.
20:02
Oh, that is um, that is wildly unpleasant. No sweetness,
20:06
no clarity, nothing about that is pleasant.
20:09
That is a terrible, terrible brew of coffee.
20:12
And in comparison, this is almost heavenly.
20:15
So I think that the pressure,
20:17
there's a couple of things.
20:18
One, the limit of the paper really is quite low, right?
20:23
Even at sort of 0.3 bars of pressure,
20:25
you can sort of see
20:26
a change in the color of the liquid,
20:28
indicating more stuff is getting through the paper.
20:31
The question this makes me think about is,
20:33
you've had this infusion phase.
20:35
Can you do kind of bed prep, right?
20:37
Should there be a period of time
20:39
after you swirl to let the coffee settle down
20:41
as evenly as possible and sort of prep and neat bed
20:44
before you press,
20:45
will that help the taste?
20:47
So that's a quick experiment I wanna run next,
20:49
where we're just going to do a regular brew
20:50
and we'll press with identical pressure,
20:52
and then we'll after we swirl,
20:54
we'll let the grounds sort of fall down
20:56
for maybe 30 seconds and then we'll press.
20:58
Obviously, we anticipate a slightly increased extraction
21:01
from the longer contact time.
21:03
But I would just be pretty interested to see
21:05
if we feel like there's more evenness
21:07
in the taste of the brew.
21:08
So now we have two of the dreaded triangles
21:10
that are often the undoing of my great ideas.
21:12
We did tweak this slightly.
21:13
So with the first brew,
21:15
we steeped for two and a half minutes
21:17
to make sure that both brews steeped
21:18
for the same amount of time,
21:19
because in the second brew,
21:20
we steeped for two minutes, swirled,
21:22
let the bed settle for 30 seconds and then pressed.
21:24
So they both started pressing at 2:30 to make it even.
21:28
This bowl over here has more sweetness.
21:31
It's quite noticeably different.
21:33
I would say to the other two.
21:34
That feels less enjoyable.
21:37
To me that feels like the odd bowl out.
21:39
This one is the odd one out is B,
21:42
which would mean I liked it more.
21:45
And it is the one where you have the settling.
21:48
So in theory if I'm right, this one should say A.
21:52
It does not, wrong.
21:54
So my confidence was half correctly placed
21:56
and half misplaced.
21:58
I would say tasting them afterwards
22:00
is always a kind of a lesson
22:03
in how easily manipulated your brain is.
22:08
Like here, I felt like it made a really big difference
22:09
and it, you know, I picked it quite clearly.
22:11
Here, it was more subtle.
22:14
And now I can taste it afterwards.
22:15
I can taste that it is the odd one out,
22:17
but I can't otherwise.
22:19
From my point of view,
22:20
I probably build it into my technique
22:21
because I'd rather err on the side of caution
22:24
and improve things on average than not.
22:27
A clean cut win would be beautiful,
22:29
but really we're into the minutia
22:31
of AeroPress brewing here.
22:32
And small details are just that, small details.
22:37
Let's move on to a big detail in AeroPress brewing.
22:39
Let's talk about temperature.
22:42
So first test is actually preheating.
22:44
Now, a lot of people just preheat an AeroPress
22:46
by pouring some water into the plunger chamber
22:48
with a paper inside to rinse the paper and do that thing.
22:51
I want to take it to extreme to see how big the impact is.
22:53
So this one here is preheating with freshly boiled water,
22:57
should be fully pre-heated,
22:59
I'll throw it away in a second,
23:00
throw in some coffee into both of them,
23:02
and put the same temperature water in,
23:03
and we'll see how big of a difference it makes
23:05
to the brewing liquor,
23:07
the brewing temperature to have preheat the brewer.
23:09
So that might be a little bit unexpected.
23:10
I certainly found that somewhat unexpected.
23:13
I thought there'd be at least a degree or two difference,
23:14
but really heat lost is happening
23:16
out of the top of the brewer.
23:18
And that's the same whether your brewer is preheated or not.
23:21
And that speaks to the thermal efficiency
23:22
of the material of an AeroPress.
23:24
You know, if you pour hot water into AeroPress
23:26
and you hold it,
23:27
it takes really quite a long time
23:28
for that heat to get to your hand.
23:31
So it's a very good insulator, which makes sense.
23:33
So preheating an AeroPress
23:35
from a brew temperature perspective, not necessary.
23:37
And you might say, ah, but what about rinsing a paper?
23:40
We'll come to that.
23:41
First, I wanna talk more about brew temperature.
23:44
Because it's a highly discussed
23:45
highly divisive aspect of AeroPress brewing.
23:47
Some people really, really believe
23:49
in the 80 to 85 degrees Celsius thing, others don't,
23:53
they believe in brewing as hot as possible.
23:54
We'll use a temperature controlled kettle,
23:56
load it with different temperatures,
23:58
and we'll taste our way through
23:59
and talk about how flavour, in certainly lighter roasts,
24:02
evolves and changes with brew temperature.
24:04
So we've got our five bowls
24:05
going from 75, 80, 85, 90 and boiling point.
24:08
And this, I've done loads of times in my career
24:10
as an experiment.
24:11
I think it's really interesting to do as a taste test.
24:13
If you have the kit and the time,
24:15
I would recommend you try it.
24:16
A couple of tiny points to note
24:18
that as we went down in temperature,
24:19
the amount of foam forming in the brew decreased,
24:22
and it got harder to press,
24:24
during the pressing portion of each one,
24:25
you know, temperature does play a role in viscosity.
24:27
And that probably impacts pressing,
24:29
not very important, just kind of interesting.
24:31
Let's talk about taste.
24:32
Starting down at 75,
24:35
it's really not bad, it's okay, it's fine.
24:37
There's not a lot of character or nuance to it,
24:40
but it's not unpleasant.
24:41
There's no dominant acidity.
24:42
There's no real astringency, it's just nice.
24:46
And as you got to 80, yeah,
24:48
it gets a bit more of that.
24:49
You get a little bit more texture,
24:51
it's very sweet,
24:51
it's very pleasant,
24:52
but it's not hugely interesting.
24:55
What's interesting for me,
24:56
is that these next two bowls
24:57
at sort of 85 and 90 get worse.
25:01
Like I think this is better than this
25:02
and this is worse than everything so far.
25:04
And then suddenly at boiling point,
25:07
certainly with lighter roasts, magical, delicious,
25:10
complex, nice acidity, you know, tastes well-extracted,
25:13
it's the best cup here, for me of a lighter roast.
25:16
The second best cup is here.
25:18
And that's confusing.
25:19
I've talked about this phenomenon before.
25:21
In the espresso series,
25:22
talking about temperature,
25:23
we did talk about how espresso
25:24
at 80 can be surprisingly good,
25:27
and maybe at 90 kind of isn't,
25:29
but at 93, 94, 95, much better again,
25:32
It's a weird phenomena and kind of proof there's no one way
25:35
to brew coffee.
25:36
In addition, if I was using darker roasts,
25:38
I suspect that these temperatures were to do even better.
25:41
And I might get a peak
25:43
in there sort of 90 or 95 zone compared to the 75 to 80,
25:46
but the 80 would do pretty well
25:49
for kind of everything.
25:50
It'll do well for darker roast,
25:51
medium roast and light roast.
25:53
You just won't get the full range of complexity
25:56
in your coffee,
25:57
you'll have a nice cup,
25:58
but it won't be the best it could be.
26:00
And searching for the upper end of that brew temperature
26:02
is gonna give you the best in terms of clarity,
26:05
complexity, and all of the flavours
26:06
that you spent your good money on.
26:09
There's one thing left to talk about.
26:11
Something we've kind of avoided talking about all day.
26:13
We touched on it briefly
26:15
when it came to preheating the brewer,
26:16
but should you be rinsing your AeroPress papers?
26:22
This is the last question I wanna answer before I wrap up.
26:24
So it's could to be another triangle test.
26:26
I'm going to brew four brews,
26:27
two with rinsed papers, two without,
26:29
two sets of triangles.
26:30
Can I detect a rinsed paper over an unrinsed paper?
26:33
So our last triangle tasting test of the video,
26:36
and if I pull this one off, I will be blown away.
26:39
I'll be very surprised.
26:40
This is gonna be tricky.
26:41
These brews are identical except a tiny piece of paper
26:44
in one case has been rinsed, and the other, it's dry.
26:47
Let's dive in.
26:47
On either of these, I don't know.
26:50
I guess you.
26:51
This is random at this point.
26:53
(slurps)
26:58
That one... this... I don't know.
26:59
I don't know.
27:01
I wasn't right.
27:05
And I wasn't right.
27:06
Unsurprisingly, I don't think you can taste the difference
27:10
between a rinsed and unrinsed paper.
27:12
This kind of makes sense.
27:13
The idea that you could taste the difference
27:14
between a rinsed and an unrinsed paper in an AeroPress
27:17
is kind of interesting, right?
27:19
An AeroPress paper weighs about 0.17 grams.
27:23
It's very small.
27:24
And if you brew say,
27:25
200 mls of liquid with that,
27:27
your ratio of paper to coffee is really quite low.
27:31
Now, at the other extreme,
27:32
you've got like a Chemex paper,
27:33
which is four and a half grams.
27:35
And if you brew, say 500 mls of coffee with that,
27:37
you've actually got 10 times more paper per liter,
27:41
so to speak in contact, than with an AeroPress.
27:43
I would say with an AeroPress,
27:44
it's just an unnecessary additional step,
27:47
and an unnecessary waste of water
27:49
and potentially heat energy
27:50
if you're using hot water to rinse that paper.
27:52
I'm not saying that's true of papers across the board.
27:55
I'm just saying with an AeroPress,
27:57
I'm not sure I see a benefit.
27:58
I certainly can't taste a benefit.
28:01
Let's wrap up.
28:05
So firstly, thank you for joining me
28:06
on this journey into the AeroPress.
28:08
This video has been an interesting mix for me
28:10
of demonstrating kind of principles of brewing
28:13
and also uncovering some new information
28:15
and running some kind of fun tests.
28:17
All of this is of course in service
28:19
of me creating what I hope
28:20
will be an ultimate AeroPress technique.
28:23
What I'm trying to do with the ultimate technique,
28:24
is not create the most convoluted and complex recipe
28:27
with thousands of steps.
28:28
I want to find the opposite, actually.
28:30
I want to find the neatest,
28:31
simplest, cleanest way to get you repeatably
28:34
to a great cup of coffee with an AeroPress,
28:35
to have that brewer be
28:36
an enjoyable part of your morning coffee routine.
28:39
That's the goal.
28:40
And of course, that's the next video coming up.
28:42
But it may not have to be the last AeroPress video.
28:44
There are of course more experiments we could do.
28:46
There's more questions to ask and answer.
28:48
Lemme know down in the comments below
28:50
what else we should look at.
28:52
What other aspects of AeroPress brewing
28:53
are worth some exploration?
28:55
I'm not trying to create the one best technique,
28:57
I'm trying to offer a great technique,
28:59
my perfect technique.
29:01
But there's still so many options.
29:03
So many different ways to use this brewer.
29:05
Let know your thoughts down in the comments below.
29:07
But for now,
29:08
I'll say thank you so much for watching.
29:10
I hope you have a great day.
0:00
Today we're gonna talk about espresso puck prep.
0:02
We're gonna go through the techniques and the tools involved
0:04
in getting your ground coffee
0:06
ready for optimal brewing inside an espresso machine.
0:10
And today we're gonna talk
0:10
about techniques that I hope are universal,
0:12
whether you've got a cheap espresso machine
0:14
that you've just started with.
0:15
Whether you've got a very expensive,
0:17
high-end espresso machine,
0:18
everything I talk about today
0:19
should be applicable to what you do.
0:22
Now, the goal of espresso puck prep
0:23
is basically to get that little puck of coffee ready
0:27
so that when the water flows through it,
0:28
it flows through as evenly as possible.
0:32
That's it, that's the goal.
0:33
We want it to flow through at a certain kind of time,
0:35
we want to control how much liquid goes through it,
0:37
but those are kind of outside
0:39
of the prep piece of this thing.
0:40
Now, I come from the professional coffee world,
0:42
the cafe world, where there seems to be frighteningly
0:45
little puck prep in most places, even good places.
0:48
They seem to dose the coffee, maybe settle it a little bit,
0:50
maybe distribute it,
0:52
tamp it, brew it, and it's good.
0:54
And we're gonna do a lot more than that
0:55
because I think we can get better espresso.
0:58
And again, our goals are kind of different.
1:00
Cafes wanna make good espresso
1:02
as quickly and easily as possible as they can.
1:04
We wanna make incredible espresso
1:06
every time we make espresso.
1:07
What I'm gonna do is go through
1:09
each of the stages of puck prep
1:10
and talk through some of the options that you have
1:12
and some of the techniques that people use,
1:14
the impact that they have,
1:15
and give you what is ultimately my opinion
1:17
about how important they are.
1:19
Is it worth doing?
1:20
Now, as you'll see in front of me, there's a lot of stuff.
1:23
There's a lot of stuff involved in espresso puck prep,
1:25
and I'm aware that maybe I have a reputation
1:28
of spending other people's money by making them want things.
1:31
Please, please, please maximize your current setup
1:33
before you think about upgrading.
1:35
You're definitely gonna have a little bit of FOMO here
1:38
or a kind of desire for one more new thing.
1:41
Try and keep that in check
1:42
until you're sure it's gonna solve a problem that you have.
1:45
To end this video, I'll share my personal puck prep routine.
1:48
I'll make a kind of real-time espresso
1:50
starting from the beans to ending it with a drink,
1:52
everything in between, because I don't do
1:53
every single thing that I'm gonna talk about today
1:56
when I make espresso.
1:57
So first step is kind of gonna be bean prep,
1:59
and I'm gonna recommend for many people,
2:01
especially when they're starting
2:02
and getting to know their grinder,
2:03
weighing both the input and output from the grinder.
2:06
So you're gonna weigh your coffee beans,
2:08
and then you're gonna weigh the grounds
2:09
once they're in the portafilter as well.
2:11
Not every grinder is a zero retention grinder
2:14
or a low retention grinder, so you wanna make sure
2:16
that you're getting out what you're putting in.
2:18
So for me here, I'm gonna dose 18 and a half grams in
2:20
and I'm gonna grind it, and then I'll weigh it
2:22
in the portafilter to see how we've done.
2:24
Now, this is maybe tangential to puck prep,
2:26
but it's kind of part of the whole routine.
2:28
I'm gonna use what's called the Ross Droplet Technique.
2:30
You can either, I think the first time I started doing this,
2:33
I would get a teaspoon wet,
2:34
just run it under a tap and stir it into the beans.
2:36
More commonly now, you're gonna get a little spray bottle
2:39
and just spray a single spray over those coffee beans.
2:42
If you're doing this once or twice a day,
2:44
I think it's fine to spray every single dose.
2:46
If you're making a lot of espresso,
2:47
you'll find that your weighing vessel gets a little damp
2:49
and you don't need to spray.
2:51
If your manufacturer of your grinder
2:52
recommends you don't do this,
2:53
then maybe you just use the sort of teaspoon method.
2:56
But for most grinders,
2:57
a little spray of water on beans does absolutely no damage.
3:00
It reduces static and reduces retention,
3:02
and that makes it a good thing.
3:04
The last little thing is before I dose coffee
3:06
into my portafilter,
3:06
I'm gonna make sure my basket is completely dry.
3:09
I like to use a little bit of toweling for that.
3:12
Nice and dry and clean.
3:13
Dosing into a wet basket
3:14
can sort of encourage water to flow
3:16
where water's already been,
3:17
and you get a kind of additional flow
3:18
around the edges of the puck rather than through it,
3:21
or so goes the theory.
3:22
Anyway, to grind.
3:24
(beans rattle)
3:25
So on the scale, we've got 18 and a half grams out.
3:28
That's kind of what we wanted,
3:29
and so we can move into the next phase,
3:31
which is ultimately the most important phase of puck prep,
3:34
and that is distribution.
3:37
Things are gonna get a bit more opinionated here,
3:39
but first I'm gonna talk about one more tool,
3:41
which is a dosing funnel.
3:42
They look like this,
3:43
and they sit on top of your portafilter.
3:45
This one, I particularly like because it has magnets
3:48
so it sticks really nicely on there
3:49
so it's just a little bit more reassuring,
3:51
but it's not by any stretch essential.
3:53
This is useful in the next phase
3:55
with different kinds of distribution
3:57
because it will prevent spillage and mess.
3:59
Because if we take it off and look at the basket right now,
4:02
we've got this mound of coffee in the middle,
4:04
and around the edges,
4:06
we've got some coffee sort of gaps or troughs, so to speak.
4:09
If I just compress this now with my tamper,
4:12
I will not have an even bed of coffee.
4:14
The thinner parts of the bed
4:15
will be much easier for water to get through,
4:17
and so more water will flow through less coffee,
4:20
and that won't taste great.
4:21
So what we need to do is distribute the coffee
4:24
evenly around the basket.
4:26
There's a number of ways to do that.
4:27
Additionally, you'll see that there's kind of clumps here,
4:29
where as part of the grinding process,
4:31
the grounds have almost been slightly squeezed together,
4:34
and they will stay as clumps after they've been tamped
4:37
and there'll be a more dense pocket of coffee
4:39
compared to the pocket around them.
4:40
Again, they promote uneven extraction.
4:42
We wanna get rid of the clumps.
4:44
So, as I said,
4:46
there's kind of four approaches to distribution.
4:48
And that brings us back to tools.
4:50
This one here is my favorite.
4:51
It's by a company called Sworkdesign
4:53
It's a bit more expensive, I confess.
4:55
You can make these yourself actually quite cheaply.
4:57
You can get a cork from a wine bottle
4:59
and some acupuncture needles,
5:00
and be on your way to something very similar to this,
5:02
or you can buy a kind of finished tool,
5:04
or there's kind of option's in between.
5:05
They don't have to be expensive,
5:07
but I think they are a very good tool.
5:10
You can get this style, which has the loops on the end here.
5:13
These for me, I don't really recommend,
5:16
I don't particularly like the looped-ended tools.
5:18
I prefer a finer needle.
5:20
In a kind of more commercial sense
5:21
where you might wanna go a bit faster,
5:23
you do have things like this.
5:25
So this was a sort of cheap thing I think AliExpress.
5:28
This sits on top of the portafilter,
5:30
it has a spring inside,
5:31
(tamper rings)
5:32
and then you twist it
5:33
to essentially rake the needles around in there.
5:36
This particular one I don't recommend
5:37
'cause the needles don't go deep enough.
5:39
The one I do recommend of this style is insanely expensive.
5:43
It's called DUOMO The Eight and it has less needles,
5:46
but its build is very nice.
5:48
This sort of sits on top.
5:50
You spin it and it does some distribution.
5:52
It breaks up clumps.
5:53
It comes on a little stand that cleans it,
5:55
and if I was trying to do this in a cafe,
5:57
this would make sense.
5:58
At home, I'm just not sure I could recommend
6:00
you spend this much money.
6:02
Back to the job in hand.
6:03
What we're gonna do is get our needles in there
6:06
and start deep, start right at the bottom of the basket
6:09
and essentially stir and move around the coffee inside.
6:12
We're looking to make sure
6:13
that the coffee's evenly distributed from the base.
6:16
Any clumps in the bottom section are broken up,
6:19
then work up a little bit higher
6:20
until you're just sort of dealing with the top section,
6:23
and you should have afterwards
6:25
a very nice, even looking bed of coffee.
6:27
This for me is sort of prepped
6:29
and ready to tamp and move on with.
6:31
Now, I would recommend it.
6:32
I like it, but there are other ways
6:34
to distribute coffee before tamping,
6:35
and so let's talk about the next one,
6:37
which is wedge distributors.
6:39
So in the world of wedge distributors,
6:41
there's a few different styles.
6:42
I think most people are familiar
6:43
with the one from Ona Coffee from Sasa Sestic
6:46
that was known I think initially as the OCD,
6:48
the Ona Coffee Distributor.
6:49
There's also something like this from Pullman,
6:51
which again works in a similar kind of way.
6:54
And the idea is that this thing
6:55
is gonna go and do kind of two jobs.
6:57
As you move it around,
6:58
it's gonna smooth the coffee around
7:00
inside the basket to help distribute it.
7:02
It's also in that process gonna apply some pressure
7:05
to the point that some people recommend
7:07
just distributing and not tamping.
7:09
So it goes in and you rotate
7:13
and you smooth it around,
7:14
and you end up with what looks very nice.
7:18
It looks very even,
7:19
it's quite satisfying, it feels like it's well tamped.
7:21
You've done a good job, so to speak.
7:23
One thing you can do to sort of compare them
7:25
is get something like this.
7:26
This is a 58 millimeter glass jar.
7:29
Yes, you do a reasonable job
7:31
of kind of moving coffee around the top part of the basket,
7:34
but I think with wedge distributors,
7:35
they're just not really touching
7:37
the stuff in the bottom half or having real impact there,
7:40
and so for me, I'm just not a huge fan of them.
7:43
I don't think they're necessarily damaging to your espresso,
7:47
but I just say, I just prefer needle distribution for me
7:50
and the style of espresso that I drink.
7:52
The third style of distribution we should briefly talk about
7:55
is one that has pretty much fallen out of fashion,
7:57
but is very much how I learned,
7:58
which is what I would call manual distribution
8:01
or just using your hands.
8:02
When I started in coffee,
8:03
coffee grinder technology was pretty poor in some ways
8:06
and grinders did not produce
8:07
a fixed dose of coffee for you every time you wanted one.
8:11
Instead, you had to use your basket
8:12
as a kind of volumetric fill.
8:14
That meant you had to be very consistent
8:16
in the way that you distributed your coffee
8:18
to make sure that you had an even basket full
8:20
and why to this day
8:21
I hate volumetric measurements in cooking.
8:23
There were really two major techniques around.
8:26
If you bought David Schomer's book when it came out,
8:28
you'll have seen he kind of did
8:29
a north, south, east, west distribution,
8:31
where you kind of push the coffee around
8:33
with a flat finger like so
8:34
to try and get it to be all over the bed.
8:37
If you were into espresso around the,
8:40
I don't know, early 2000s,
8:42
you'd have seen what was called
8:43
the Stockfleth's distribution method
8:45
that used the sort of bit of your thumb here,
8:47
and you would smooth it around like that on a finish,
8:51
and then it looked, you know, okay.
8:54
It's a really easy technique to mess up
8:56
and be inconsistent with.
8:57
The last one on the distribution front
8:59
that I wanna talk about is vibration distribution,
9:01
because I think a lot of people
9:02
are curious if this is a good idea or not.
9:04
In fact, you can buy a vibration distributor for espresso.
9:08
This is the Nurri, and this is what it's for.
9:10
Your portafilter would sit in here,
9:12
and then you run it (Nurri vibrates)
9:14
and it would vibrate your bed of coffee.
9:16
And in theory, you'd think that would help,
9:17
that would help sort of settle it out very evenly.
9:21
I'll show you how it works.
9:22
(Nurri vibrates)
9:24
It's kind of fun and you get some distribution for sure.
9:26
It doesn't really break up clumps in the same way.
9:29
And the interesting thing about this,
9:31
and I think this was tested in "Modernist Cuisine"
9:32
using sort of ultrasonics as well,
9:35
is that you seemingly get some movement of fine particles
9:38
down to the bottom of the basket.
9:40
Flow with this is slower
9:42
than with sort of needle distribution
9:44
as a kind of comparison point,
9:46
so it seems to be that you get a little sandbagging.
9:48
There's lots of fines
9:49
that sort of sit at the bottom of the puck,
9:52
and that for me isn't a great thing,
9:54
though it is a fun and interesting little toy to play with.
9:56
Now, one other piece of puck prep kit
9:58
that I think is notable and kind of interesting
10:00
is also from Sworkdesign, who I mentioned earlier.
10:02
They make the PorcuPress,
10:04
which is really interesting.
10:05
This is another collection of sort of acupuncture needles
10:08
designed to sit on top of your prepped
10:12
but not yet tamped bed.
10:13
And then you're supposed to press it down,
10:16
rotate it a little bit,
10:17
press it down, rotate it a little bit again.
10:20
and press it down.
10:21
And in doing so,
10:23
you have produced an enormous number of holes
10:25
across the bed of coffee.
10:26
Now, the idea is that when you tamp this now,
10:28
you'll have kind of seeded pathways
10:30
for water throughout the puck.
10:33
It's interesting.
10:34
It's another expensive tool.
10:37
There is an impact from it.
10:38
I think Sprometheus did a good video
10:39
about this particular thing.
10:41
I'll leave a link to that down below,
10:42
but it is just an interesting thing
10:44
to see people experimenting with these kind of ideas
10:47
for what I think are incremental gains,
10:50
but I'm never gonna be against incremental gains.
10:52
So next up is an interesting one,
10:54
and I would say it's the thing
10:55
that was the biggest surprise in testing.
10:58
It was definitely something
10:59
that kind of caught me by surprise a little bit,
11:01
despite the fact that I've been aware of this now
11:04
for a good long while,
11:04
and that is using a little bit of paper
11:06
at the bottom of your espresso basket.
11:09
Now this started I think originally
11:10
with people concerned about the quantities
11:13
of some of the lipids in coffee in their espresso.
11:15
There have been some papers
11:17
linking consumption of kind of unfiltered coffee
11:21
to blood cholesterol and therefore to heart disease.
11:24
I'm not saying that's a thing
11:25
and I don't really wanna get into that in this video,
11:27
but that's what started this whole thing off.
11:29
Now, a bit of paper like this at the bottom
11:31
will filter out any fine pieces from your coffee,
11:33
and that means you'll get no flecking,
11:35
no tiger stripes on top of your espresso anymore.
11:37
It will filter out some of the lipids in coffee,
11:39
some of the oils, and that will have a small
11:42
but noticeable impact on texture and mouth feel,
11:45
but it's actually not as big as you'd think.
11:47
It does have another super interesting impact.
11:50
In testing, it caused the flow of the espresso
11:53
to increase quite dramatically.
11:55
Shots that we're pulling at say 28, 29 seconds
11:57
were suddenly pulling at 23 seconds.
12:00
And in doing so,
12:01
it also increased their extraction quite notably.
12:05
The frustrating thing is that it's actually quite hard
12:07
to get a food safe bit of paper
12:09
that fits the bottom of the basket.
12:10
Some people have been using scientific papers.
12:12
They are not rated as kind of food safe.
12:15
I don't think there's a huge risk there,
12:17
but you should be aware of the risks
12:18
of kind of non-food safe papers.
12:21
Here I'm using a Pullman basket
12:23
because it fits a hole-punched Chemex paper.
12:27
So you can buy hole punches of two and a quarter inches
12:29
very easily on the internet.
12:31
I'll leave a link down below,
12:32
and then you can just punch out from something
12:33
like a Chemex filter paper a bunch of these little things
12:37
and they fit some baskets very well.
12:39
Some people like to wet the paper before they dose,
12:41
just to make sure that there's no kind of impact
12:44
of the WDT or the needle distribution at that point.
12:47
I haven't seen any inconsistency
12:49
or issues with the dry paper.
12:51
Obviously you don't wanna
12:52
get the sides of the basket too damp.
12:53
You wanna keep those nice and dry,
12:55
but yeah, the bottom can be a little bit damp.
12:57
That's okay.
12:58
(espresso machine buzzes)
13:02
Now, as you can see, it has no negative impact on crema.
13:05
There's plenty of the good foamy stuff on top
13:07
if that's what you like.
13:08
That's a tasty, clean, balanced espresso.
13:10
I sort of hate the fact that I feel this way.
13:12
It's more work, it's more effort, it's a bit more waste,
13:15
but I like what a paper filter
13:18
at the bottom of an espresso basket does to the shot,
13:20
to the extraction, to the whole process.
13:24
I don't think it's essential,
13:25
but I do think it's worth experimenting with,
13:28
though I wish there was just an easier way
13:30
to get filter papers for these things
13:31
that fit espresso baskets and that fit say VST baskets,
13:34
because VST baskets are a different size.
13:36
You'll see the Aeropress is that little bit bigger,
13:38
so it absolutely will not fit inside a basket.
13:40
And some people have been doing
13:42
a kind of sandwich of these things,
13:43
so one at the bottom and also one at the top,
13:46
though that has become less common
13:47
with the advent of the next thing to talk about,
13:49
which are puck screens.
13:51
These are puck screens.
13:52
These are sort of thick discs of metal mesh
13:55
designed to sit exactly on top of your puck,
13:58
edge to edge inside your basket,
14:00
and do a couple of things.
14:01
Firstly, they should act
14:03
as an additional water distribution aid.
14:05
They should help the water coming from the shower screen
14:07
spread more evenly over the puck of coffee.
14:09
Secondly, the theory is that they prevent
14:12
sort of excessive expansion of the puck during pre-infusion,
14:16
which helps create a more even extraction afterwards.
14:19
Do they work?
14:20
Well, in testing, I think they do, yes.
14:22
I saw an increase in extraction when using these.
14:25
It wasn't an enormous increase,
14:26
but it was consistent
14:27
and it was consistent across different brands,
14:29
which was good to know.
14:31
They are, however, frustrating and fussy things to use.
14:34
They're irritating and difficult to clean.
14:36
Some people have resorted to ultrasonic cleaning baths.
14:39
Steaming them with some Cafiza or espresso machine cleaner
14:43
isn't a bad option either,
14:44
but they are a little bit of faff,
14:47
and so whether they are worth it, so to speak,
14:50
in terms of the cost of buying one,
14:51
the sort of pain of using one really depends
14:55
how obsessed you are with squeezing
14:56
every last single drop out of the coffee that you have.
14:59
All of this leads us to the last stage
15:01
of espresso puck prep, which is tamping.
15:05
Now, obviously you'll tamp and then put on say a puck screen
15:08
if you're gonna do that,
15:09
but I figured this was kind of a nice last step
15:11
to talk about.
15:12
If you wanna use a traditional tamper,
15:13
then the ergonomics are important
15:15
in terms of looking after your body.
15:17
You wanna hold it kind of like a doorknob,
15:18
thumb pointing down the whole tamper.
15:21
And when you tamp,
15:21
you wanna have your elbow right above the coffee,
15:24
as if you're about to sort of screw in a screw
15:26
that might be sticking out of the wood surface.
15:28
You've got a screwdriver in your hand
15:29
and you would get right over it
15:31
so you could drive down and apply pressure.
15:33
Now here, you don't need to twist.
15:34
You're just looking to press down as evenly as possible
15:37
until the coffee stops feeling squishy.
15:38
That's it, and you're trying to press as much air
15:40
out of the coffee as you can
15:41
to make sure that the bed is even,
15:43
there's no air pockets left behind.
15:44
I like to rotate the tamper very slightly
15:47
so that with my fingertips I can feel if I'm level or not.
15:50
If I'm not level, I'll feel it as my fingers rotate.
15:53
Twisting, polishing, that kinda stuff,
15:55
I learned to do it and no one knows why we did it.
15:58
We've mostly stopped doing it.
15:59
It feels nice.
16:00
It feels a little bit flashy.
16:01
It does nothing for your coffee, so don't worry about it.
16:03
That's a traditional tamp.
16:04
On the tamping front, there are obviously other options.
16:06
You can use a wedge distributor.
16:08
You do have things like this, which is the Force Tamper,
16:11
which is a very expensive solution to a problem.
16:13
Now, when it comes to tamping pressure,
16:15
it's kind of a binary thing.
16:17
You've either pushed hard enough
16:18
to get rid of the air pockets or you haven't.
16:20
Pushing harder than hard enough
16:23
makes no difference to extraction
16:24
or flow rate or anything like that,
16:26
so it's not a a complexity of the espresso brewing process
16:29
or of puck prep,
16:30
but something like this will sort of stop pressing
16:33
at a certain pressure.
16:34
You'll hear a kind of click
16:36
(tamper clicks) like that,
16:37
where you've crossed a threshold of pressure
16:39
and you've definitely pressed hard enough
16:41
and it won't press any harder.
16:42
Additionally, the sort of design of this
16:44
means that it sits on the rim of the basket
16:46
and it should tamp perfectly level every time.
16:48
These are expensive.
16:50
They're very nice and they definitely take away a variable
16:53
that some people worry about,
16:54
and they sort of strip some of the pleasure of espresso.
16:57
So for some, it is a good worthwhile investment.
16:59
For others, it doesn't really make
17:03
a good return on their investment.
17:04
If they're comfortable, safe, and consistent
17:06
in their manual tamping,
17:07
then they may enjoy using one of these things.
17:09
And there a lot of beautiful tampers out there.
17:12
I made a video about that once.
17:13
Now I'm aware we've gotten to this point
17:15
and we've covered a lot of ground.
17:16
And in doing it this kind of way,
17:19
I feel like I've thrown a lot of information at you,
17:21
which is why at the end of this thing,
17:23
I kind of want to just go through a real-time puck prep
17:26
so you can see what it looks like and decide for yourself,
17:29
is this seemingly too much faff or is it too much work,
17:31
or actually, is it pretty simple and easy
17:33
and probably worth the time and effort involved?
17:36
But before we do that,
17:37
we do need to have a quick ad for this video sponsor,
17:39
which is Surfshark.
17:41
Surfshark is a VPN that is fast,
17:43
easy to use, easy to install,
17:45
and with one account,
17:46
you can install it on unlimited devices.
17:49
Now you might ask, why do you need a VPN?
17:51
And I think there's a couple of really good use cases
17:53
in the real world for using a VPN
17:55
and having it be part of your life.
17:57
Firstly, it lets you travel the world virtually.
18:01
You wanna explore content on streaming services
18:03
in other countries,
18:04
well, you can log in
18:05
to one of their 3200 different servers,
18:08
find something in the country you want to go to
18:10
and unlock the content that is georestricted
18:12
that you couldn't otherwise access.
18:14
And secondly, a VPN adds a layer of security
18:16
and anonymity to your online browsing.
18:18
It might be that you are concerned about your security
18:20
in an online environment, in a public wifi,
18:23
or it might be that you just wanna get
18:24
the best possible deals,
18:25
and VPNs can help you sort of prevent people
18:28
georestricting prices or showing you worse prices
18:32
based on where you are.
18:33

18:47
Now let's make some espresso.

20:37
One last thing before we close out:
20:39
This t-shirt, that print over there,
20:42
is the Coffee is an Act of Kindness design
20:44
that we've had actually for a little while now,
20:46
and we've just launched it now.
20:47
All proceeds, all profits from the t-shirt and the print
20:50
will go to four different charities
20:52
all operating and helping with the crisis,
20:55
with the war in Ukraine
20:56
being, I think, grotesquely waged by Russia.
20:58
It's horrifying to see
21:00
and so we wanna support it in some way,
21:01
so these are now available.
21:02
The t-shirts are limited run.
21:04
The poster will be around for a little while, as well.
21:07
If you like it,
21:08
click the link down the description below.
21:10
But now I wanna turn the questions, of course, over to you.
21:12
Tell me about your puck prep.
21:14
Tell me what you've changed recently.
21:16
What has made a big impact
21:17
to the espresso that you drink every day?
21:19
Does this all seem too much, not worth the effort,
21:22
a sign of obsession?
21:24
Let me know down in the comments below,
21:25
but for now, I'll say thank you so much for watching
21:28
and I hope you have a great day.
0:00
- Today we're gonna bust some caffeine myths.
0:02
Now recently a company called Lighttells
0:04
made a relatively inexpensive caffeine analyzer
0:08
and so immediately I had to buy it.
0:11
It's in here.
0:12
Now I say relatively because it was still around $2,500,
0:16
but that's cheaper than anything else I've seen.
0:17
Now the reason I was so interested to get it is
0:19
because there's been loads of studies on caffeine,
0:22
but honestly, most of the time I haven't really trusted
0:25
either the quality of coffee they were brewing
0:27
or the quality of brewing that they were measuring.
0:30
And suddenly I could do a bunch of tests
0:33
and ask a bunch of questions
0:33
and get a bunch of real answers
0:35
that are relevant to me and the coffee that I drink
0:37
and the coffee that you drink at home or in cafes every day.
0:40
First of all, I'll show you how this machine works
0:42
'cause it is kind of interesting
0:43
and then we'll get into the really fascinating stuff.
0:47
We're gonna cover things from instant coffee
0:49
to espresso brewing to roast levels
0:50
and there are some surprises in this whole thing.
0:54
This is it.
0:54
I know it doesn't look like $2,500,
0:56
it doesn't look very exciting,
0:57
but I promise you it is.
0:59
The way it works is kind of annoying, if we're honest.
1:02
Turn it on.
1:02
That bit's fine and I'll connect to it with my phone
1:04
in a second.
1:05
But we need to talk about how you actually do
1:07
a single caffeine test.
1:09
And there, there's some bad news.
1:10
Each test requires this pack of reagent and stuff.
1:15
There's a chip, there's some pipettes,
1:16
and there's some reagent in there.
1:18
Let me show you.
1:21
There's a little chip.
1:22
The chip is what you insert into the machine.
1:24
All of this is single usage.
1:26
You can't reuse a chip, you can't reuse a reagent.
1:29
And so each test, each single test, requires this kit
1:33
and this kit costs £7.50 per test
1:36
which is wasteful and expensive.
1:38
So I had to make sure to make every test count
1:40
which we did.
1:42
So these two are connected and I can begin my test.
1:44
I'm gonna need to get a sample of coffee.
1:46
I happen to have some coffee just here.
1:47
These are kind of cool.
1:48
These are pipettes that allow you
1:50
to capture a very fixed, consistent amount of liquid.
1:53
That full straw section is what you'll always get.
1:58
And so we've got a full little tube of coffee there.
2:01
That gets mixed with this here reagent.
2:04
In it goes, give it a shake for 10 seconds
2:06
and then we just need to cover the reading area of the chip
2:10
with coffee.
2:11
I can hit start
2:13
and the analysis can begin.
2:15
And we've got a result.
2:16
We're gonna talk about caffeine levels
2:17
in a couple of different ways.
2:18
We'll talk about the total amount of caffeine
2:20
in a drink and we'll also talk about the caffeine level
2:24
per 100 milliliters or deciliter.
2:26
That's kind of how the little machine works.
2:28
Bear in mind that the daily recommended allowance
2:31
of caffeine for most people is up to 300 milligrams.
2:34
I did make a whole video about caffeine.
2:36
I'll link it in the description down below
2:37
but let's move on with that first test.
2:39
So the first test we wanted to do was filter coffee
2:42
versus espresso.
2:43
Was there a difference in how much caffeine you get
2:45
based on how you make your coffee?
2:48
If you took 18 grams of coffee
2:50
and you brewed it as an espresso, to say 36 grams of liquid,
2:53
but you extracted a fixed amount of coffee that way,
2:56
let's say 21% of the ground coffee was extracted
2:58
into the beverage, and then you made a filter coffee
3:01
with 18 grams of coffee, same coffee again.
3:03
But here you used 300 mls of water to extract 21%,
3:08
let's say.
3:09
If you compared those two identical extractions
3:13
was there a difference in caffeine?
3:14
Turns out, oh wow, there really, really is.
3:18
The average espresso in testing,
3:20
the whole espresso if you drank that whole double,
3:22
had 110 milligrams of caffeine.
3:25
If you drank that whole filter coffee,
3:27
again, from exactly the same amount
3:28
of ground coffee at the start,
3:30
but if you drank that whole beverage,
3:32
170 milligrams of caffeine.
3:35
That is nearly 50% more caffeine
3:38
in the filtered coffee than the espresso.
3:41
This absolutely blew my mind.
3:43
This was astonishing to me
3:44
because the extraction was the same!
3:47
I could imagine a little difference
3:49
but a difference this big,
3:50
I could not get my head around.
3:54
This needed further testing to try and understand
3:56
what exactly was going on here.
3:59
This led us to the second group of experiments.
4:03
Here what we wanted to do was track what was happening
4:06
with both coffee extraction and caffeine extraction
4:09
during the course of the brew
4:11
for both filter coffee and for espresso.
4:14
Now the way you do this is relatively simple.
4:17
You would make a coffee as normal.
4:18
Let's say you make a pour over,
4:20
but underneath it, you're gonna catch that resulting liquid
4:22
in five different bowls.
4:24
So you catch, say, 50 mls in the first bowl,
4:26
50 mls in the second bowl, 50 mls in the third,
4:29
and so on and so on.
4:30
And so you can slice out the brew into five parts
4:33
and you can do exactly the same thing with espresso.
4:35
So you catch the first, let's say, 10 mls in one cup,
4:38
the next 10 mls in another,
4:39
the next 10 mls in another.
4:40
And you can split it out.
4:42
Now you have to know how much your bowls weigh
4:44
and you can calculate then the mass of liquid
4:46
exactly inside.
4:47
You can then measure the concentration of both solubles
4:50
and caffeine and you can build a cumulative chart,
4:54
what's happening over time,
4:56
which is what I'm gonna show you now.
4:57
And we'll start with filter coffee
4:59
because I think that's a nice place to start here.
5:02
And so the first chart that I'm gonna show you,
5:04
along the horizontal x-axis, it has mass
5:07
and along the vertical y-axis, you would see extraction.
5:11
Now what you're seeing here is at the start,
5:14
the extraction increases very rapidly.
5:16
And if you look at the color of the liquid
5:18
coming out of the bottom of your filter cone,
5:19
it is much darker.
5:21
There's lots more solubles coming out at that point.
5:23
And you'll see as we progress the brew
5:24
and more water passes through the coffee,
5:26
that rate of extraction starts to slow down
5:29
and kind of flatten out.
5:30
You know the coffee coming through the cone
5:32
right at the end looks much, much, much paler.
5:34
Let's look at exactly the same chart,
5:36
but instead of total solubles,
5:37
let's just look at caffeine.
5:39
And again, mass along the x-axis,
5:41
total caffeine on the vertical Y.
5:44
And it looks very similar.
5:45
At the start it extracts really pretty quickly.
5:47
And again, as we start to run out of caffeine
5:50
in the ground coffee, that rate slows.
5:52
And so what you can then do if you want to,
5:53
it's a bit nerdy I know,
5:55
is you can then chart solubles extraction
5:57
against caffeine extraction.
5:59
And here you'll see that there's a pretty
6:01
linear relationship.
6:02
The more coffee you extract from the grounds,
6:05
the more caffeine you get with it.
6:07
Pretty simple.
6:08
But let's look at espresso
6:09
because that I think is where we see some changes.
6:12
So here again, same first chart.
6:14
Along the bottom we've got mass,
6:16
along the y-axis we've got total extraction.
6:19
And again, espresso extracts very quickly at the start.
6:22
That first liquid out is dense and gooey and delicious
6:25
and it gets thinner and kind of waterier as you go,
6:28
so the same thing happens.
6:30
But if you look at the caffeine versus mass chart here,
6:33
you'll see that it kind of starts to look
6:36
a little different.
6:37
The caffeine seems to lag a little bit
6:40
behind the total extraction.
6:42
And so when you chart out caffeine extraction
6:45
and coffee extraction,
6:46
you see quite clearly there's a big lag
6:49
in caffeine extraction in the early phases
6:51
and then it picks up speed.
6:52
Hi there!
6:53
I just wanted to interrupt
6:54
because I forgot to say this in the video.
6:56
If you pull more like a lungo,
6:57
like a 3 to 1 ratio, a longer espresso,
7:00
do expect more caffeine
7:02
for the same overall extraction.
7:04
You'll see that from this chart, again,
7:06
caffeine is accelerating towards the end,
7:08
and so longer espressos do have more caffeine.
7:11
Not as much a pour over, but definitively more.
7:13
Okay, thanks, bye -
7:14
Now this particular shot was with a Niche grinder.
7:16
I'll show you a different chart now.
7:18
This one from the OPTION-O, the P100,
7:20
so are a bigger burr grinder,
7:21
and here this caffeine lag is way more obvious
7:25
which I think is really, really interesting, though
7:26
that grinder extracts very, very quickly
7:29
right at the start too.
7:30
So it feels like some aspect of caffeine extraction
7:35
is linked to contact time.
7:38
That's the only thing I could think of
7:39
with the kind of variable between these two things.
7:42
Is it that just espresso happens so quickly
7:45
that there's not enough contact time
7:47
to get the caffeine out,
7:48
even though there is enough contact time
7:50
to get all those good delicious soluble materials out?
7:53
That led to the next experiment.
7:54
For this one, we required the use of the trusty Aeropress
7:58
and the experiment here was gonna be pretty simple.
8:00
We were gonna take a traditional Aeropress recipe,
8:02
12 grams to 200 grams of water.
8:05
And what we were gonna change,
8:06
for a fixed grind setting, was just the contact time.
8:09
The kind of steep time initially before the swirl,
8:12
the settle, and the press.
8:14
And we did a bunch of different tests here
8:16
going from a 30-second steep to a 20-minute steep.
8:20
Broadly what you'd expect to see happen
8:22
with extraction, happened.
8:24
The longer your contact time went on,
8:26
the more you extracted.
8:28
This is news I feel to almost nobody.
8:30
We know that the longer something steeps in water,
8:32
the more stuff comes out of it.
8:34
However, the caffeine extraction rate
8:37
very quickly started to flat line.
8:39
In fact, once you'd brewed and steeped for two minutes
8:42
in that particular phase,
8:44
you didn't see any additional caffeine extraction
8:46
really happening regardless of how long you steeped for.
8:50
And so you don't have to worry
8:52
that having a really long steep time,
8:54
which can taste really good in say an Aeropress
8:56
or even a French press, that's not giving you more caffeine
8:59
than you otherwise would have.
9:01
It's seemingly having little to no impact
9:03
on the caffeine once you cross that threshold
9:06
of steep time where you're getting what you need out.
9:08
I don't understand this and I feel like this is
9:11
one particular area that needs loads more testing
9:15
but there's a lot more to talk about.
9:17
So we need to talk about instant coffee.
9:19
And this is one area - this is THE area where
9:22
I've made the biggest mistake
9:23
and essentially spread the most misinformation by mistake.
9:27
Now I'll give you an anecdote
9:29
that I've heard quite often, people often said to me,
9:31
"I used to drink instant and now I drink specialty,
9:33
I drink fresh coffee.
9:34
And I feel like there's way more caffeine in that".
9:37
And I would typically reply "that seems surprising
9:40
because instant coffee pretty much everywhere
9:43
is mostly made with Robusta, as a species,
9:45
which has twice the caffeine content of Arabica".
9:49
And I was also pretty confident that
9:51
during the extraction process that would've gotten
9:54
all of the caffeine out of the Robusta.
9:56
And so my theory had been,
9:58
my presumption had been there was more caffeine
10:02
in instant coffee than there would've been
10:03
in fresh coffee because fresh coffee was made
10:06
of better quality coffee that started with
10:07
less caffeine in there.
10:09
Then I did some testing
10:11
and it did not go the way I thought it would.
10:13
Instant coffee compared to a pour over
10:16
has way, way less caffeine in it.
10:19
This is a slightly tricky thing to say
10:21
because obviously the way that you make instant coffee
10:24
will have a big impact on how much caffeine is in there.
10:27
Now if you get a jar of Nescafe gold,
10:30
you don't have to, but if you did,
10:31
it will tell you on the side to take 1.8 grams
10:34
of instant and mix that into 200 mls of hot water.
10:38
They are proposing you a cup of coffee
10:40
that is incredibly weak, actually,
10:42
a 0.9% strength compared to a typical filter coffee
10:46
that would be say 1.3 to 1.6, somewhere in that range.
10:49
So they're saying: brew it weak.
10:51
And, you know, maybe for good reason.
10:53
What we wanted to do was actually have instant
10:55
be a comparable strength to filter coffee
10:57
to compare those two things.
10:59
So we then took 3 grams of instant
11:02
for 200 mls of water,
11:03
which then gave us a 1.5% strength beverage
11:06
at the end of it.
11:07
So how much caffeine are we talking about?
11:10
Now here, rather than talk about
11:12
total beverage amounts here,
11:13
we're gonna talk about caffeine concentrations
11:15
per 100 mls, per deciliter.
11:17
Instant coffee made the way they tell you to
11:20
had just under 40 milligrams of caffeine per deciliter.
11:26
If you made it the way that we might
11:28
to get the matching strength,
11:29
that would go up to 60 milligrams per deciliter,
11:33
roughly speaking.
11:34
A lot of the pour overs that we measured
11:37
were actually more like 80 milligrams per deciliter.
11:41
That means if you made two matching size cups
11:44
of industry standard instant
11:46
versus industry standard pour over,
11:48
you might have twice the caffeine
11:51
per serving in the specialty coffee.
11:54
This to me was shocking, it was astonishing.
11:57
And what I had massively underestimated
12:00
and kind of forgotten about was just how much
12:03
of those grounds instant coffee manufacturers
12:05
are extracting.
12:06
We tend to see a ceiling of about 30%
12:09
being the maximum.
12:10
Instant coffee manufacturers are able to go higher
12:12
through a number of processes.
12:14
They're just using way, way, way less coffee beans
12:18
per cup of coffee and then getting you
12:20
to make it pretty weak.
12:21
Now we did go out and test the cheapest,
12:23
strongest, harshest instant we could find,
12:26
presuming that to be the purest kind of Robusta,
12:28
and therefore probably the highest caffeine.
12:30
That was higher.
12:31
But again, at industry standard 0.9% strength,
12:34
that was still only 55 milligrams of caffeine per deciliter.
12:38
So still not near the caffeine strength
12:40
of good specialty coffee.
12:42
This has definitely been misinformation I've spread.
12:44
I apologize for this now.
12:45
I did not realize how wrong I was
12:47
but if you have a friend or colleague
12:49
that seems to get through like five cups of instant coffee
12:51
a day and be fine, well this is why.
12:54
It just doesn't have that much caffeine in it
12:57
compared to good fresh coffee.
12:59
As a side note, we did at one point
13:02
measure the concentration of a V60 brewed with Lavazza,
13:06
which is obviously some Robusta in that.
13:09
It's still fresh coffee.
13:10
How is the caffeine concentration there?
13:12
Yeah, it was over 100 milligrams per deciliter.
13:15
So you know, again, cheaper raw materials
13:18
and Lavazza Rossa does have some Robusta in it,
13:20
will have more caffeine in them.
13:21
So specialty is less caffeine than cheaper fresh coffee
13:26
but it's still more than instant.
13:28
The last test that I wanted to do for this video
13:31
was one that I get asked about a lot.
13:33
I was asked about it in the recent video I did with Wired
13:35
on their channel for doing coffee support.
13:37
And that is, is it true that there is less caffeine
13:40
in darker roasted coffee?
13:42
It a question you get asked a lot.
13:43
The reason people ask it is the fact that
13:45
caffeine sublimates, which means it goes
13:48
from being a solid to a gas at temperatures achieved
13:51
in the upper ends of roasting temperatures.
13:54
The idea is that as you roast a coffee dark,
13:56
you're driving caffeine out of the bean,
13:59
it's sublimating out,
14:00
and so dark roasts have less caffeine in them.
14:02
I was always highly skeptical of this
14:04
but I wanted to test it.
14:05
And so we took a coffee, one particular coffee,
14:07
we did a sample roast of it
14:08
to a slightly underdeveloped, under roasted way,
14:11
a kind of normal roast,
14:12
and then a dark roast into what's called second crack
14:15
which is a stage in roasting
14:16
that would be a measurement point for darker roasts.
14:20
You could go much darker than this
14:21
but I didn't really want to.
14:22
Then we would take each of those three samples
14:24
and brew them as a pour over to matching extraction levels.
14:29
Then we'd compare the caffeine
14:31
and the results were super, super interesting.
14:35
Turns out the dark roast filter brew
14:37
had the highest concentration of caffeine
14:39
and it was a pretty big difference.
14:41
So the dark roast brew for a matching extraction
14:43
in terms of total solubles was
14:45
72 milligrams of caffeine per deciliter.
14:48
The medium roast, traditional normal roast,
14:50
had about 67.5 milligrams of caffeine in it.
14:53
And the very light, slightly underdeveloped roast
14:55
had 62 milligrams per deciliter of caffeine in it.
14:59
So that's a pretty large swing there.
15:02
Now I think there's two reasons for this.
15:05
Firstly, the longer you roast coffee,
15:07
the less dense it gets.
15:09
Like that 10 kilos of coffee you might load
15:11
into a commercial roaster,
15:13
what you're getting out at the end of it
15:14
is going down the longer you roast.
15:16
So a light roast, you might end up with only 8.5 kilos,
15:19
with a really dark roast, you may only end up with,
15:21
say, 8 kilos of coffee.
15:23
Now a lot of what goes away is moisture
15:25
but other stuff does essentially degrade
15:27
and disappear out during the roasting process.
15:30
This means that to make up, say, 10 grams of coffee,
15:34
you would need more dark roasted coffee beans.
15:37
But this doesn't explain everything
15:39
because actually if you count how many
15:42
dark roasted coffee beans we needed for 10 grams
15:44
versus the the medium roast versus the light,
15:46
well medium to dark, you needed about 7% on average
15:50
more coffee beans to make up 10 grams of coffee.
15:53
But we were seeing an increase in caffeine
15:55
of around 8.5%.
15:57
So it wasn't just that you needed more beans.
16:00
That darker roasted coffee is more porous,
16:03
it's less dense, and I think part of that means
16:06
it's even easier to extract every scrap
16:08
of caffeine that's in there.
16:10
Conversely, that drop in caffeine that we saw
16:12
with the under-roasted coffee meant that
16:14
it might just be harder to get the caffeine out
16:17
from a much denser, less roasted coffee bean,
16:20
as well as you just need less beans to make up your dose
16:23
of coffee that you're gonna start with.
16:25
This I thought was super interesting
16:26
and it kind of goes with my own experience
16:28
and my own kind of theories coming into this.
16:31
So I was pleased to be proved right,
16:32
but I definitely didn't expect the swing
16:35
that we saw from light to medium to dark
16:38
in terms of total concentration.
16:39
A highlight of the video for me, a highlight of the testing!
16:43
Now one thing I do wanna acknowledge at this point
16:45
is that you'll see different numbers
16:47
at different times for the same brew method.
16:50
You'll see a pour over that seems to yield 65
16:52
or 70 milligrams in one case
16:54
and a pour over, same recipe, that yields say 80 milligrams
16:57
per deciliter in another place.
16:59
Different coffees do have different caffeine levels
17:02
in them and that definitely showed up in our testing.
17:05
What we would definitely do when we were testing something
17:07
was use the same coffee for say espresso and filter
17:09
or the same coffee for all of the tests
17:11
to try and isolate that variable.
17:13
But coffee itself is a variable.
17:15
Generally when we saw Ethiopian coffees used,
17:18
they seem to have fractionally less caffeine
17:20
than other coffees we used.
17:22
We didn't see a massive variance amongst high quality,
17:25
high growing specialty coffees
17:27
but we did see some variance
17:29
and the amount of testing we would need to do
17:31
to give you guidance there is enormous.
17:34
It's on the list, but it's enormous.
17:37
Generally speaking, I think we know that
17:39
caffeine is the plant's response to insects
17:42
and that the higher you grow coffee,
17:44
the less caffeine the plant tends to produce.
17:46
I think that's a good, very broad rule of thumb
17:49
that will absolutely have exceptions to it,
17:51
but it's a good place to start.
17:53
But yeah, know that some of the variance you'll see
17:55
in those final numbers is down to the fact that
17:58
the coffee used was different
17:59
'cause we wanted to test lots of coffee,
18:00
lots of grinders, lots of brewers,
18:02
all of that kind of stuff,
18:03
to get to useful actionable insights
18:06
about how you're gonna brew and drink
18:08
and enjoy coffee day-to-day.
18:09
Now, I know there's other tests you'd probably like me to do
18:12
and I want to hear about them down in the comments below.
18:14
What should I have tested,
18:15
what's left out there that you really want to know?
18:17
I'd love to hear your thoughts and your ideas.
18:19
And even if you don't have an idea,
18:21
let me know which of these tests was the most interesting
18:23
or relevant to you, which was the biggest surprise.
18:26
I have really enjoyed this video.
18:27
This has been a massive learning experience for me.
18:30
I've definitely been humbled by it.
18:31
I've been inspired by it.
18:32
It's been a ton of fun.
18:33
And I hope it is very useful and interesting to you.
18:36
But for now, I will say thank you so much
18:39
for watching and I hope you have a great day.
0:00
Today we're gonna talk about caffeine.
0:01
It's the most widely consumed psychoactive drug
0:04
in the world, most commonly consumed as coffee.
0:08
And we're all familiar with the effects of caffeine
0:10
but what exactly is caffeine?
0:12
Why do plants produce it?
0:14
What does it do to our bodies
0:16
and is it good for you?
0:18
Now, from a chemical perspective,
0:19
caffeine can be described as both a methylxanthine
0:22
and an alkaloid.
0:24
The first name refers to the shape
0:26
and composition of the caffeine molecule
0:28
while alkaloids as a whole are a broader group
0:30
of naturally occurring organic compounds,
0:33
defined by having at least one nitrogen atom.
0:36
Alkaloids have many functions and effects
0:39
but almost all are bitter in taste.
0:41
Caffeine occurs naturally in more than 60 different plants
0:44
but more surprising then that
0:45
is that those plants each develop
0:47
different biochemical mechanisms
0:49
and pathways to create caffeine.
0:51
This is a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.
0:54
Most people associate caffeine with coffee
0:57
and it is named for coffee
0:58
but it also occurs in tea,
1:00
chocolate, kola nuts, guarana seeds
1:03
and even the flowers of citrus plants.
1:06
Plants produce caffeine primarily as a pesticide.
1:09
It deters insects from attacking or eating the plant,
1:12
in part with its bitter taste,
1:14
but caffeine is also toxic to some herbivore insects.
1:17
It does also have one super interesting function.
1:20
Studies have shown that caffeine
1:22
can improve the memory of bees,
1:24
helping them create a stronger association
1:27
between the smell of a coffee flower
1:29
and its sweet nectar.
1:30
This might be why caffeine exists
1:32
in very low concentrations in the nectar
1:34
of certain flowers, like the citrus flowers
1:36
we mentioned before.
1:38
It gives those plants a competitive advantage
1:40
in the world of pollination.
1:42
Human consumption of caffeine likely starts back
1:45
in 3,000 B.C. with the consumption of tea.
1:48
And tea, gram for gram,
1:50
has more caffeine than coffee
1:52
but we just use more coffee when we make a cup.
1:55
The beginning of coffee consumption
1:56
is a little bit harder to pinpoint
1:58
but by the middle of the 15th century,
2:00
we're pretty confident that coffee drinking
2:02
had taken hold in Yemen and the surrounding areas.
2:05
With both tea and coffee,
2:07
very early records shows that people liked it
2:09
for the stimulating properties of caffeine.
2:12
Credit for the discovery of caffeine
2:14
is not quite clear cut.
2:16
In 1819, a German chemist named Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge
2:20
isolated what he called kaffebase,
2:24
a nearly pure caffeine extract.
2:26
He did this work apparently
2:27
at the suggestion of the famous writer,
2:29
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
2:31
Runge is also notable
2:33
for having been the first to isolate quinine
2:35
and also for the invention of paper chromatography.
2:38
In 1821, it was discovered independently
2:40
by French chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet
2:43
to whom caffeine's discovery had traditionally,
2:46
historically been credited.
2:48
It was also discovered at the same time
2:50
by two other French chemists working together,
2:52
Pierre-Joseph Pelletier
2:54
and Joseph Bienaime Caventou.
2:57
Pelletier was the first to use the word caffeine
2:59
in print, though Robiquet was the first
3:02
to isolate and describe the properties
3:04
of pure caffeine.
3:06
In that pure form,
3:07
caffeine is a white, crystalline powder
3:09
that has a pretty bitter taste.
3:11
If you take a large enough dose, it's toxic
3:13
but in lower doses,
3:14
if you look at how it affects humans,
3:15
you start to understand its enduring popularity.
3:19
Now, most people consume caffeine
3:20
by drinking coffee and it's absorbed initially
3:23
through the gastrointestinal tract
3:25
and then 30 to 60 minutes after consumption,
3:27
that's when it reaches peak concentrations in the body.
3:30
Let's get into some biology here.
3:32
Now, caffeine affects the body
3:33
with three different mechanisms.
3:35
Firstly, caffeine blocks the receptors in the body
3:38
for a compound called adenosine.
3:40
Under normal circumstances,
3:41
adenosine triggers these receptors
3:43
and it produces a feeling of relaxation
3:46
and even drowsiness for some people.
3:48
And so caffeine prevents this from happening,
3:51
while also causing the body to increase production
3:53
of dopamine and noradrenaline.
3:55
This is the mechanism behind most
3:57
of the effects that we all experience with caffeine,
3:59
this inhibition of adenosine.
4:01
It happens at relatively low doses
4:03
and gives us that feeling of wakefulness
4:05
or alertness that we associate with a cup of coffee.
4:08
This mechanisms might also explain the kind
4:11
of caffeine crash that many people experience
4:13
with a sudden feeling of tiredness and exhaustion.
4:15
It might be that once the body metabolizes all
4:18
of the caffeine, then the adenosine
4:19
is finally able to trigger those receptors
4:22
and really, really make us feel tired and drowsy.
4:25
Caffeine also causes the release of calcium
4:27
inside of muscle cells
4:29
and it can prevent or slow its reuptake.
4:32
This increased availability of calcium
4:34
increases the power output of the muscles
4:36
but it does require a pretty large dose to occur,
4:39
around 500 milligrams for an average person.
4:42
Caffeine can inhibit what are called phosphodiesterase,
4:45
now, if you stop these enzymes working properly,
4:48
then you can actually cause the body
4:49
to burn more fat.
4:51
But for this to work,
4:52
it also requires a much larger dose
4:54
than people would typically get
4:55
from drinking a few cups of coffee in a day.
4:57
Caffeine affects the central nervous system.
4:59
Caffeine makes us feel more alert, more awake
5:02
and has been shown to improve memory.
5:04
However, the beneficial effects of caffeine
5:07
aren't as clear cut as we would like.
5:09
Several studies have now shown
5:10
that that improved mental clarity that we get
5:13
when we drink coffee in the morning,
5:14
well, that comes from alleviating our withdrawal symptoms,
5:17
rather than actually improving our cognitive functions.
5:20
One positive impact is the increasing evidence
5:23
for caffeine's ability to act as both a treatment
5:27
for some aspects of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's,
5:29
as well as having some preventative properties as well.
5:32
Now, caffeine could be said
5:34
to be the last legal performance-enhancing drug
5:37
but it wasn't always this way.
5:38
Between 1984 and 2004, caffeine was actually
5:42
on the Olympic Committee's banned list.
5:44
If they tested your urine
5:46
and you were at a higher concentration
5:47
than 12 micrograms per milliliter, you were out.
5:52
And to hit that level,
5:53
you could do it with just five to eight cups
5:55
of coffee in the morning.
5:56
And because people metabolize caffeine differently,
5:59
this was ultimately an unfair thing to police
6:02
and after 2004, it was off the banned list.
6:05
Now, as we talked about before,
6:06
caffeine does affect the muscles,
6:08
it does affect power output
6:09
but it does seem less effective
6:11
with habitual users of caffeine.
6:13
Though it does impact the perception
6:15
of exertion and fatigue,
6:17
which is kind of interesting.
6:18
For people using caffeine for sport,
6:20
they're typically dosing three to five milligrams
6:22
per kilo of body weight.
6:24
Now, not everyone has a positive experience with caffeine
6:27
and we do need to talk about that.
6:28
Symptoms like mild anxiety, jitteriness,
6:32
insomnia, reduced coordination,
6:34
these are all symptoms people can suffer
6:36
with even mild caffeine consumption.
6:38
Caffeine can have a negative effect on anxiety disorders
6:41
and doses above 300 milligrams
6:43
can worsen someone's anxiety.
6:45
However, lower, more moderate doses
6:49
have been shown to be associated
6:51
with reduced symptoms of depression.
6:53
Consuming coffee regulatory does leave you susceptible
6:55
to experiencing caffeine withdrawal if you stop suddenly.
6:59
Now, most people can experience a big headache
7:02
that can last a little while.
7:03
They can become irritable, fatigued,
7:05
some can get flu-like symptoms or struggle to concentrate.
7:09
Typically these symptoms will last
7:10
for up to 24 hours, though occasionally,
7:12
it can go on for longer
7:13
and people have experienced caffeine withdrawal
7:15
for up to three days.
7:17
So how much caffeine exactly is considered healthy?
7:22
Recommendations are quite broad
7:23
because people respond to
7:25
and metabolize caffeine a little bit differently
7:28
but current guidelines are for an adult,
7:30
it's no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day.
7:33
And that's 200 milligrams
7:34
if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.
7:36
Soft drinks, energy drinks, tea
7:38
are all popular sources of caffeine
7:40
but coffee is by far the most popular.
7:43
But with soft drinks and energy drinks,
7:45
there is typically a fixed
7:46
and known amount of caffeine in them.
7:48
You can look up on the internet how much coffee
7:50
is in a can of Coca-Cola.
7:51
With coffee, you can't.
7:54
A cup of coffee will have quite a dramatic variance
7:56
in its caffeine content,
7:57
depending on a number of factors.
7:59
The coffee itself will play a role.
8:01
Arabica has half the caffeine content of Robusta
8:04
but the recipe or the way that it was brewed,
8:06
these will all have an impact.
8:09
And they've gone and done tests
8:10
and bought coffees from different cafes
8:12
and there's been a pretty wide range reported,
8:14
anywhere from around 65 up to over 300 milligrams
8:17
in a single cup.
8:19
Various governments and governing bodies
8:21
have tried a few times
8:22
to legislate coffee companies
8:23
to have them tell you exactly how much caffeine
8:25
is in your coffee-related product
8:27
but so far, that's never happened.
8:29
It's always been successfully lobbied against.
8:31
Excessive caffeine consumption
8:33
can be quite unpleasant
8:34
and actually, it can be fatal.
8:37
To reach caffeine toxicity,
8:38
you'd have to ingest around 10 grams of pure caffeine
8:42
in a day.
8:42
To do that, you'd have to drink between 50
8:44
and 100 cups of coffee.
8:46
So it's actually pretty rare
8:47
that anyone reaches that from drinking coffee.
8:49
More often, people have died from caffeine intoxication
8:52
from consuming too many caffeine pills
8:54
or other medications that may contain caffeine.
8:57
I think for those of us who drink
8:58
and enjoy coffee all the time,
8:59
it's really important
9:00
to understand a bit more about caffeine.
9:02
This is a psychoactive drug
9:04
that we're taking every single day.
9:06
We should understand what it is
9:08
and how it affects us.
9:09
Now, I know you'll probably have questions
9:10
about decaf and decaffeination
9:12
and I promise, I'll answer them all in a future video.
9:15
And if you wanna know more about caffeine,
9:17
I've left you some reading down
9:19
in the description below.
9:20
But for now, I'll say thank you so much for watching
9:23
and hope you have a great day.

0:14
- Welcome to another episode
0:15
in the Beginner's Guide to Coffee,
0:17
and today we're covering espresso-based drinks.
0:19
Now, that doesn't mean I'm gonna give you
0:21
an exact recipe for all of the 15 different drinks
0:23
that we're gonna cover.
0:24
That would take a really, really, really long time.
0:26
Instead, I'm gonna give you a little bit of a history,
0:29
the kind of idea behind the drink,
0:31
so that you know what to order,
0:33
what you might expect when you do,
0:34
and what you might want to make at home.
0:37
So, first on the list, let's talk about espresso.
0:40
(relaxing music)
0:43
Espresso is now incredibly difficult to actually define.
0:46
It is basically a small, strong coffee
0:49
brewed under pressure, typically topped
0:51
with a red-brown foam called crema.
0:52
That seems a little wishy-washy,
0:54
but there's loads of different ways
0:55
to make espresso these days.
0:56
Now, the Italian National Espresso Institute,
0:59
which of course exists, and I'm very happy it does,
1:01
does have a very precise definition for Italian espresso,
1:04
and I'll show that to you here.
1:05
When you talk about espresso, especially online,
1:08
there's a bit of a confusion
1:09
between what is a single and what is a double,
1:11
because here we've got, say, seven grams of coffee
1:13
for a single espresso,
1:14
but often you'll see recipes
1:16
for 14, 18, 16, 20 grams of coffee.
1:19
That's because they're brewing
1:20
inside a double basket and not a single basket,
1:22
so they're basically brewing two shots of espresso,
1:24
a double espresso.
1:25
Now, you'll see Italian espresso
1:26
talks about milliliters in the cup,
1:28
that's a volume measurement,
1:29
whereas modern espresso talks about grams in the cup.
1:31
And if you have grams in the cup,
1:32
and how many grams of coffee that you used,
1:34
you have what are called ratios,
1:36
so the ratio between ground coffee and liquid coffee.
1:38
A traditional espresso is in the one-to-two,
1:42
to one-to-three range, right?
1:44
So that's how much liquid you typically produce
1:46
in around 25 to 30 seconds,
1:48
typically under, say, six to nine bars of pressure
1:51
at a brew temperature between 88
1:52
and probably 96, 97 degrees Celsius.
1:55
I don't want to be overly prescriptive about what it is,
1:57
because it can and should be lots of different things,
1:59
but that ratio will give you a pretty good idea
2:01
of what to expect from a traditional espresso.
2:03
And as I said, modern coffee shops typically serve you
2:05
a double espresso as standard.
2:07
Traditional coffee shops will typically serve you
2:09
a single espresso as standard.
2:11
Another quick note, if you're in Italy,
2:13
you'll probably notice that no one really orders
2:15
an espresso at the bar.
2:16
They say, un caffe, right?
2:17
They just say, a coffee.
2:18
That is the default way of brewing coffee in Italy,
2:20
so if you order a coffee, you get espresso.
2:23
(relaxing music)
2:26
A common variation on an espresso is a ristretto.
2:29
That name means restricted, and the flow is restricted,
2:31
and the idea is from the same amount of ground coffee,
2:34
you get less liquid.
2:35
And that liquid will be more intense, thicker, oozier,
2:38
more kind of textured than a normal espresso.
2:41
The easy way to do that is just to cut the shot short
2:44
and let less liquid flow through the coffee.
2:46
The better way to do it is to grind a little finer
2:48
so the whole flow is slower,
2:50
and you're able to properly extract the coffee
2:52
using less water.
2:53
But in terms of ratios, a ristretto would be,
2:55
say, one-to-one, or, say, one-to-one-and-a-half.
2:57
That would be broadly speaking
2:59
the definition of a ristretto.
3:01
(relaxing music)
3:04
Increasingly popular in modern coffee shops is the lungo.
3:07
It just means a long coffee.
3:09
Here, the ratio is much higher.
3:11
Typically, it's not just the case
3:12
of pushing more water through the same puck
3:14
that you would brew an espresso with.
3:15
Here, you'd be grinding coarser
3:17
and allowing a lot more liquid to flow
3:19
in a kind of similar brew time.
3:21
Here, the ratio might be, say, one-to-three,
3:23
up to one-to-five, one-to-six,
3:25
and that's kind of the limits,
3:26
really, of a traditional lungo.
3:28
(relaxing music)
3:31
Next up is espresso con panna.
3:33
Now this is a drink more commonly seen outside of Italy
3:35
than inside of Italy.
3:36
It's not a traditional drink necessarily.
3:38
Here, it's just an espresso
3:40
topped with a little whipped cream or double cream.
3:42
It's also more commonly seen served with darker roasts,
3:45
where you'd want to buffer
3:46
a bit of that bitterness with the cream.
3:47
It's not typically served with lighter roasted,
3:49
more modern style specialty coffees.
3:52
(relaxing music)
3:54
The macchiato is a complicated drink these days,
3:58
but it shouldn't be.
3:58
The name means marked or stained,
4:01
and I think its history most likely goes back
4:02
to a traditional espresso bar in Italy.
4:04
There, lots of coffees would be served.
4:06
You'd kind of order your drink,
4:07
pick up something that was served on the bar
4:09
sort of separately.
4:09
Here, if you wanted just a little bit
4:11
of milk in your espresso,
4:12
which is kind of what the drink is, then that would happen.
4:14
But, because of the crema on an espresso,
4:17
if you pour just a little milk into a drink,
4:19
you can't necessarily tell
4:21
which one has just a splash of milk in it.
4:23
So in order to tell which one was which,
4:24
the barista would grab that jug of milk,
4:26
grab a little teaspoon of foam,
4:27
and dot the one that had a little milk in it
4:29
with a dot of foam on top.
4:30
So that way, when you walked up to the bar,
4:32
you could see easily which one had a little milk in it.
4:34
This was how it was served for a long time,
4:36
until really latte art became incredibly popular.
4:39
And at that point,
4:40
a macchiato became an entirely different drink
4:42
because baristas wanted to flex a little bit
4:45
and pour nice-looking patterns in espresso cups,
4:47
because it's hard to do and it looks quite cool.
4:49
So the drink has more recently shifted,
4:51
and a modern macchiato is a kind of one-to-one
4:54
of espresso and milk,
4:55
steamed milk with a thin layer of foam on top.
4:57
However, we should mention the caramel macchiato,
5:00
which Starbucks has used to confuse almost everyone,
5:02
where you have a kind of latte
5:04
drizzled or marked with caramel,
5:06
and I think that has caused a great deal of confusion
5:09
over the last 10 or 15 years in many, many coffee shops.
5:12
(relaxing music)
5:15
Espresso romano, Roman espresso, I guess,
5:18
is served very simply.
5:19
It is a shot of espresso with some lemon in some form.
5:23
Now, you see it served either as a twist of lemon
5:25
or as a little slice of lemon.
5:27
I would say with lighter, kind of modern specialty coffees,
5:29
I would avoid the lemon slice,
5:31
and I would go for a lemon twist
5:32
because you're adding quite a lot of acidity
5:34
to an already quite acidic beverage.
5:35
But with a darker roast, that little lemon slice
5:37
might contribute just a little lift in acidity
5:39
and be really quite pleasant.
5:41
(relaxing music)
5:44
The cortado is another drink
5:45
that's gotten a little bit confusing.
5:47
It is historically speaking a Spanish or Portuguese drink.
5:50
It's most commonly seen there,
5:51
and it is a one-to-one of espresso and steamed milk.
5:54
These days, it's become a little bit
5:56
like the sort of macchiato in that it's a full cup,
5:59
so the barista can pour latte art,
6:01
and it can be anywhere from a one-to-one ratio
6:03
of coffee to milk, to a one-to-three, in some cases two.
6:06
This is definitely a drink where the modern specialty shop
6:08
and the traditional style one are quite a long way apart,
6:11
and there's a huge amount of variance
6:13
in the strength or size of drinks that you will receive,
6:15
especially in modern coffee shops.
6:17
(relaxing music)
6:20
In a very similar vein is the Piccolo latte.
6:23
The name, despite being an Italian name,
6:25
probably doesn't originate in Italy itself.
6:27
It was probably Italianized outside of Italy
6:29
because it's not a drink you really ever see there.
6:32
It's a smaller latte.
6:33
Typically, it's a single shot of espresso,
6:35
and the ratio is one-to-two, to maybe one-to-three,
6:38
sometimes one-to-four.
6:39
It crosses over with the cortado
6:40
in many specialty coffee shops,
6:42
where one shop's cortado is identical
6:44
to another shop's Piccolo.
6:45
That can be a little bit confusing,
6:47
but that's roughly the idea behind it.
6:49
It's a small latte.
6:50
(relaxing music)
6:53
The story you most often hear about the Americano
6:55
is that after World War Two,
6:57
American soldiers stationed in Italy
6:59
couldn't handle espresso,
7:00
and so had asked for it to be watered down a little bit
7:02
to be more like American coffee,
7:04
and thus was born the Americano.
7:06
It's probably not true.
7:07
Modern espresso wasn't really invented until 1948
7:10
and took a couple of years
7:11
to really gain popularity after that.
7:12
Ultimately, the idea is right, though.
7:14
This is a way of making espresso close
7:17
to American style filtered coffee in strength.
7:20
And to do that, you use hot water
7:22
to dilute down the espresso.
7:23
These days, that ratio will go
7:24
from anywhere from one-to-three, to one-to-four,
7:26
to one-to-five.
7:28
It's pretty open in that regard.
7:30
And typically a specialty shop
7:31
will put the hot water in the cup first
7:33
and pour the espresso on top.
7:34
The order you do them in
7:35
doesn't actually make any real difference.
7:37
It just looks much prettier to do water first
7:39
and then coffee on top.
7:40
(relaxing music)
7:43
No, the long black is a little bit different to an Americano
7:46
because of the culture that it came from.
7:47
This is a drink that came out of Australia and New Zealand,
7:50
and as that culture spread,
7:51
as that style of espresso brewing spread,
7:54
they were brewing a lot of up-dosed,
7:56
so a lot of coffee in the portafilter,
7:58
ristretto-style espressos,
7:59
and that was being used in a long black.
8:02
So it's a little different from an Americano
8:04
because traditionally, typically,
8:06
it's a double ristretto on top of hot water.
8:08
It's a stronger, slightly more textured drink
8:10
than an Americano,
8:11
but often there's not all that much difference in it.
8:14
(relaxing music)
8:17
The cappuccino is super interesting to me
8:18
because it has such an interesting history.
8:20
In fact, I made a whole video about this history,
8:23
but ultimately the drink predates espresso.
8:24
It goes all the way back to Vienna,
8:26
and it was called a kapuziner.
8:28
And here, you used coffee and milk and you mixed them
8:31
to the color of the Capuchin monks' robes.
8:33
That was how you described how milky, how strong,
8:36
you wanted your coffee.
8:37
Since then, it's changed a great deal,
8:39
and a modern cappuccino is defined in a couple of ways.
8:41
Firstly, it should be a relatively strong drink.
8:44
You might see a ratio of one-to-three,
8:47
to one-to-five in terms of espresso to milk,
8:50
and it should have a thick layer of foam on top.
8:52
Ideally, that foam should be micro foam,
8:54
where bubbles so small that you can barely see them,
8:56
and it's a delicious, lovely drink.
8:58
Now, there is the old rule of thirds for a cappuccino
9:00
that doesn't really make any sense,
9:01
that is one part espresso, one part steamed milk,
9:04
and one part milk foam.
9:05
Now, that means if you had a single shot
9:06
of Italian espresso at 25 mils,
9:08
then your single-shot cappuccino
9:09
would be a 75 mil drink, which it's not.
9:12
(relaxing music)
9:15
So the caffe latte is interesting.
9:17
It's another drink that evolved I think outside of Italy,
9:19
despite having an Italian name.
9:21
You don't really see it very often in Italy.
9:23
Its history or its roots
9:24
might be something like the cafe au lait,
9:26
the French drink where you'd have quite strong coffee
9:28
and equal parts of that and hot milk,
9:30
often served in a bowl.
9:32
Dip a little pastry in there, very delicious.
9:33
But the caffe latte, the modern caffe latte,
9:36
is defined by being a relatively weak drink.
9:38
The ratio of milk to coffee is a little bit higher
9:41
and it will have some foam on the drink, but not a lot.
9:44
This means it's very popular for people
9:46
who like a sweeter, milkier thing,
9:48
and popular with baristas who can pour
9:49
really nice latte art into it.
9:51
Ratio wise, it will vary quite a lot.
9:53
It can go from, say, one-to-four,
9:55
up to one-to-six, in some cases.
9:57
Often it's served as a larger drink
9:59
with a double shot in the base.
10:00
(relaxing music)
10:03
The history of the flat white is extremely contentious.
10:06
Those from Australia argue that it's Australian,
10:08
those from New Zealand would say it's from New Zealand.
10:10
It most likely originated as a kind of pushback
10:12
against the big, awful, dry, sea foamy cappuccino
10:15
of the 1990s.
10:17
People didn't want a cup that was mostly air.
10:19
They just wanted a flat, white coffee.
10:22
That was it.
10:23
Just give me not the big foamy thing, but a milky coffee.
10:26
And these days a flat white is very common,
10:28
especially in Europe, especially in the UK, actually,
10:30
in a lot of specialty shops.
10:32
It would be defined as a small, strong latte
10:35
in that it's typically a double shot drink
10:37
in say a five or six ounce cup, or 150 to 180 mil cup,
10:41
with the textured milk similar to a latte,
10:44
so a thin layer of foam on top.
10:45
Again, commonly poured with latte art
10:47
because you've got that really thin,
10:49
silky texture of milk that lets you pour
10:50
quite intricate, delicate patterns with it.
10:52
While it has been adopted
10:54
by some larger chain coffee companies,
10:56
if you see it in a specialty independent shop,
10:58
chances are there's a bit of an Antipodean influence there,
11:00
and you'll probably get pretty good coffee.
11:02
(relaxing music)
11:05
Caffe corretto is a kind of great name for this drink.
11:07
It means a corrected coffee,
11:09
and it's corrected by adding some booze to it.
11:11
This is often served as an espresso
11:13
with a little booze on the side.
11:14
Sometimes the booze is in the coffee already,
11:16
but what I most commonly see, especially in Italy,
11:19
is that people will drink the espresso,
11:20
nearly finish it, and then throw in the booze,
11:22
swirl it around and sort of capture the last of the coffee
11:25
and mix it with the alcohol and drink it that way.
11:28
As for alcohol, most often it's seen with grappa,
11:31
sometimes sambuca, occasionally cognac
11:33
if someone's feeling fancy,
11:34
but those would be the main types of booze that you'd see
11:36
in a caffe corretto.
11:37
(relaxing music)
11:41
Historically, the word mocha
11:42
kind of existed in around coffee
11:44
when it was referencing the Port of Mocha in Yemen.
11:47
Coffee from that part of the world
11:48
was often labeled as mocha,
11:50
and what became popular at one point in the industry
11:51
were mocha java blends,
11:54
theoretically blends of coffees from Yemen
11:56
with coffees from Java.
11:57
Now, this became a kind of stylistic thing,
11:59
a kind of idea rather than a traceability thing,
12:02
and people began to put other coffees
12:04
in their mocha java blends,
12:05
just to aim for that kind of chocolatey-er,
12:07
heavier taste profile.
12:08
How that connects to a hot chocolate
12:11
with some espresso in it, I don't really know,
12:13
but that seems to be the kind of rough source of the link.
12:16
As for the drink itself,
12:18
it really is pretty variable out there how it's done.
12:21
People might use sort of couverture,
12:22
sort of melted chocolate.
12:23
They might use a chocolate syrup.
12:25
There are no hard and fast rules.
12:26
You might even see powdered chocolate in there
12:28
in some cafes, too.
12:29
It is ultimately a hot chocolate
12:31
with a single or double shot of espresso,
12:33
but there's really very little in the way of rules
12:35
around what a mocha is.
12:37
In some cases, it might have some whipped cream on top.
12:39
Ultimately, you do you.
12:41
Now, there are a few slightly weirder drinks
12:43
that I just want to touch on quickly.
12:45
But before that, I want to talk about this video's sponsor,
12:47
with a short ad for Skillshare.
12:49
Skillshare is an online learning community

12:54
I use it to indulge my creativity,
12:57
to fire my creativity in a whole bunch of different things.
13:00
Sometimes that might be photography
13:02
or it might be something culinary.
13:03
Recently, it's been video.
13:05
I've really enjoyed Hallease Narvaez's class
13:07
on video for Instagram.
13:08
Sometimes I like to go back to the basics
13:10
and kind of dive right in from the beginning,
13:12
and Hallease is a great teacher.
13:14
I enjoyed this class,
13:14
not just because it was a great refresher of the basics,
13:17
but because Hallease is a great teacher.
13:18
And as someone who does a lot of teaching
13:20
and communicating through video,
13:21
watching a great teacher teach
13:22
is also super useful for me.

(relaxing music)
13:41
So the red eye is really a drink
13:42
that I've only ever seen in North America,
13:45
and it obviously references someone being extremely tired
13:48
the same way you might take a red eye flight overnight
13:50
and, you know, arrive first thing in the morning
13:52
and feel pretty terrible
13:53
and need some coffee to pick you up.
13:54
It's basically a filtered coffee
13:55
with an espresso dropped in it,
13:57
just to give it some more strength and more caffeine.
14:00
Personally, I would separate the two and enjoy an espresso,
14:02
and then take my filtered coffee with me.
14:04
But, if you're in a hurry,
14:05
I guess just throw it all together, have some fun.
14:07
(relaxing music)
14:11
Now, the breve latte is another kind of variation
14:13
that I typically only see in North America.
14:16
It refers to a caffe latte.
14:18
Instead of using milk, you're using half and half,
14:20
which if you're not familiar with it,
14:22
is half whole milk and half single cream,
14:24
so a notably higher fat content than whole milk.
14:27
That's basically it.
14:28
It's the same ratios as you'd aim for,
14:29
I guess the same texture,
14:31
though half and half won't foam identically to whole milk,
14:34
so you'll have a slight variance
14:35
in sort of foam texture there.
14:36
It is a milky, kind of fattier,
14:39
richer version of a caffe latte.
14:41
(relaxing music)
14:45
Last up, I want to talk about the gibraltar.
14:47
Now, this is actually quite a popular drink,
14:49
but quite a confusing drink.
14:50
It originates most likely in San Francisco,
14:52
most likely in Blue Bottle.
14:54
It's a drink that's named after the name of the glass
14:57
made by a company called Libbey.
14:59
They make a particular glass called the Gibraltar glass,
15:01
and if you had coffee and milk in that,
15:03
it was a kind of one-to-two kind of ratio drink.
15:06
It was quite a strong milk drink
15:08
with a little bit of foam on top.
15:09
That was a gibraltar, and that's kind of gotten out,
15:12
and it's not always served in a Libbey-made Gibraltar glass,
15:15
but that's roughly the idea behind it.
15:17
This happens once in a blue moon,
15:18
where a cafe kind of names a drink
15:19
and it kind of leaks out into the rest of the world.
15:21
It's kind of interesting.
15:22
Ultimately, if you're ordering a gibraltar somewhere else,
15:25
you're really probably ordering a Piccolo latte
15:27
or a cortado in some places, too.
15:30
It's really within that kind of family of drinks,
15:32
but it did seem worth mentioning in this video.
15:34
But now I really wanna hear from you
15:36
down in the comments below.
15:37
Did I miss a drink out?
15:38
I know I didn't put the affogato in,
15:40
but that's because it's really a dessert, not a drink.
15:42
Maybe there's a definition that you disagree with.
15:44
I'd love to hear from you.
15:45
Leave me a comment, let me know your thoughts.
15:47
But for now, I'll say thank you so much for watching
15:50
and I hope you have a great day.
0:00
Today, we're gonna talk about ratios for coffee brewing.
0:22
How much coffee should I use to brew a cup of coffee
0:25
in terms of filter coffee?
0:26
Now I'm gonna talk about this in three separate stages.
0:29
I'm gonna talk about why I'm gonna recommend
0:32
a certain type of ratios
0:33
of using grams per liter,
0:35
and then I'm gonna talk about kinda finding
0:37
your ideal ratio.
0:40
And finally I'm gonna talk about why
0:41
I might recommend a different ratio
0:43
for different brewing methods.
0:45
So first thing, why would I recommend grams per liter?
0:48
There's a number of different ways people
0:50
do recipes and ratios.
0:52
The most common ones still is to recommend scoops per cup.
0:56
There's no international standard for scoops.
0:58
A scoop can contain about seven grams.
1:00
It could contain about 10 or 12 grams.
1:02
Now the problem I have with scoops or cups
1:05
or tablespoons or teaspoons,
1:07
or all of that sort of stuff
1:08
is that they're volumetric measurements.
1:10
Which means that they'll have massive fluctuations
1:13
in actual weight depending on a few different factors.
1:16
For example, if I were to use,
1:18
let's say a dark roast, medium ground coffee
1:22
and I have a perfect level scoop of that,
1:24
that might weigh around seven, seven and a half grams.
1:27
If I went for a light roast finer ground coffee,
1:31
that might weigh eight, eight and a half grams,
1:34
well over 10% more, and that's me being really careful
1:38
in loading the same volume each time.
1:40
It's very easy to have small variances
1:42
in that volume result in pretty big variances
1:45
in the gram weight that you're using.
1:48
In the day-to-day morning coffee brewing,
1:50
using scoops will mean that some days
1:52
your coffee is good and some days it's not.
1:54
Even though you seemingly did the same thing,
1:56
but volumetric measurements, they're just not very reliable.
2:00
Then there's the other commonly used ratios
2:02
of like one to 14, one to 15, one to 16.
2:06
These break my head, I can't deal with these.
2:08
They kind of work completely backwards to me.
2:11
Those kinds of ratios are pretty useful.
2:13
If you know how much ground coffee you have
2:14
and you wanna work out how much coffee you can make.
2:18
That is never a problem I have, in the mornings.
2:21
Usually, I have a desired amount of coffee
2:23
that I wanna brew and I wanna work out,
2:25
how much ground coffee I need,
2:27
you know what weight of coffee I need to start with.
2:30
So, using a one to 15 ratio.
2:32
I can't do the maths on that,
2:33
if I need 500 mL of coffee,
2:36
I'm not dividing 500 by 15 first thing in the morning.
2:39
However, if you give me a grams per liter,
2:43
well, if I'm brewing half a liter than I need.
2:46
If at 60 grams a liter, then I need half that,
2:48
which is 30 that's not,
2:49
I don't need my phone and a calculator for that.
2:51
I can just do a quick little bit of maths.
2:54
I like it also because typically a cup,
2:56
an average cup is about 250 mL of brewing
3:00
or about eight ounces and that scales really nicely.
3:04
Whether I'm making one or two or three or four or more,
3:07
two to the grams per liter ratio.
3:09
You know I'm using half a liter, a full liter,
3:11
three quarters of a liter.
3:13
The maths is never complicated.
3:16
And there's one other kind of ratio
3:18
that deserves a special place in hell.
3:20
The mixed unit ratio,
3:22
if you are recommending grams per ounce,
3:26
get out, get out, go away, you do not belong.
3:28
Just get, that's all.
3:30
What are you doing?
3:30
That's the worst thing in the world.
3:32
Don't, ah, I mean, you know, the Imperial,
3:34
I have no time for that to begin with,
3:35
but don't be mixing Imperial and metric that is no, stop it.
3:40
Rant aside.
3:41
We end up at grams per liter.
3:43
I think it's a really nice, neat way to work.
3:46
So if it's a 60 grams per liter doing the mass with that,
3:49
that's very, very easy.
3:50
It's very, very usable.
3:51
And this leads us into the second part of this video.
3:54
What is the right amount of coffee per liter of water?
3:57
And this is a really important point
3:59
that becomes a little bit complicated.
4:02
There is no correct ratio.
4:03
There is only preference.
4:05
The ratio of coffee to water you use
4:07
is really gonna determine how strong the end cup
4:10
of coffee is, how strong you like your coffee.
4:12
that's up to you, right?
4:14
That's, your decision.
4:15
I shouldn't get a say.
4:17
I'll give a good starting point, right?
4:19
Like I think 60 grams per liter
4:21
is a pretty good one-size-fits-all.
4:23
Most people are happy with the resulting strength
4:26
of a good brew, but you can choose 55, 50, 75
4:30
that's up to you.
4:33
But, there's one complicating factor
4:35
in the world of coffee brewing and that is extraction.
4:39
I'll give a very quick primer on extraction.
4:42
In ground coffee, about approximately,
4:46
about a third of it is soluble material.
4:49
It could be dissolved by water.
4:52
Two thirds of it pretty much is insoluble.
4:54
It's cellulose, it's kind of wood.
4:56
You could steep that coffee, brew their coffee forever.
4:58
You still have some grounds left over
5:00
that you would throw away afterwards.
5:02
You don't want everything that is soluble
5:04
and available in coffee.
5:06
You want, broadly speaking,
5:08
for the sake of easy maths in the video to come,
5:10
about to 20%.
5:12
Some would prefer a little bit more, 22, maybe 23,
5:15
maybe even more, but let's say for the sake of argument
5:18
about 20%.
5:19
If you do a good job of brewing your coffee,
5:22
that will have a nice resulting strength,
5:25
but if you didn't do a good job, brewing that coffee,
5:28
that 60 grams liter would produce a weaker cup.
5:31
Let's say, you under extracted it,
5:32
you ground it to too coarse, you brew too quickly,
5:34
however it happened, you end up with a weak cup.
5:38
So if you're trying to change your ratio,
5:40
if you're trying to work out your ideal ratio,
5:43
you only want to change the ratio,
5:46
once you're really happy with the taste.
5:48
If you've brewed a cup of coffee
5:49
and you think that was delicious,
5:51
I just wish it was a fraction stronger.
5:53
That's the time to change your ratio.
5:56
If you brew a cup of coffee and you think that's a bit weak,
5:59
it's a bit sour, it's not really delicious.
6:02
Don't change your ratio.
6:04
Change your extraction.
6:05
Grind a little finer, steep, a little longer,
6:08
agitate a little bit more.
6:10
Those things need to be fixed first
6:12
before you mess with your ratio.
6:14
Once you're happy with taste, sure experiment.
6:17
In my life, I kinda wandered around in terms
6:19
of what I prefer in terms of the end strength
6:22
of my cup of coffee.
6:23
It's a personal thing.
6:24
Whatever you like is okay.
6:26
There is no one answer to this question.
6:29
This brings us into the third part of this video,
6:31
which is why I might recommend using a different ratio
6:33
for different brewing methods.
6:35
Now you can broadly divide all coffee brewing methods
6:38
into two camps.
6:39
Percolation and infusion.
6:41
Now with percolation, water is passing through
6:44
a bed of coffee.
6:46
In infusion, all of the water, and all of the coffee
6:50
are hanging out together during the brew time.
6:52
A pour-over is percolation.
6:54
A French press, an AeroPress.
6:56
Those are infusion methods.
6:59
Now, I would recommend using a little bit more coffee
7:01
for an infusion method than I would for a pour-over
7:04
for a percolation method.
7:06
I'll explain why.
7:08
Let's imagine for the sake of argument,
7:10
we're gonna brew a liter of coffee
7:11
and we're gonna use 60 grams per liter.
7:14
That's a good starting point,
7:16
and in this theoretical brew,
7:19
we're gonna extract 20% of the coffee, right?
7:22
So it means that of those 60 grams,
7:24
about 12 grams were dissolved and brought
7:27
into the liquid coffee.
7:29
Now when you brew a percolation,
7:31
when you brew a pour-over,
7:33
not all of the water that you pour in, ends up in the brew.
7:36
Typically, about two grams per gram of coffee get absorbed
7:41
by the ground coffee.
7:42
That bed still contains a good amount of water
7:44
and that water never really got involved
7:47
in the brewing process.
7:49
So what you have in the resulting brew, is 12 grams
7:52
of coffee dissolved in round about 880 grams of water.
7:57
If you take a French press and you do the same thing,
8:00
you brew 60 grams per liter,
8:01
those 12 grams of solubles that we've extracted,
8:04
that 20% extraction, that's now dissolved
8:07
into a thousand grams of water.
8:10
All a thousand grams we're involved in the brewing process
8:13
and those solubles are distributed amongst
8:15
the whole thing, that makes that brew weaker,
8:19
even though it's the same extraction.
8:22
That's why if you want a similar extraction
8:25
and a similar strength,
8:26
I would recommend using more coffee, in my infusions.
8:31
70 grams, maybe 75 grams per liter of water.
8:35
If you dive into extraction theory
8:37
and you start playing the refractometers,
8:38
you'll notice that the software does ask you
8:40
to specify if it's an immersion or a percolation,
8:44
because it does affect your extraction calculations.
8:47
But more than that, it really just affects
8:49
the strength and the taste.
8:50
So that's why with any infusion brew,
8:53
any brew where all of the ground is in contact
8:55
with all of the brew water for a period of time,
8:58
even if in the case of an AeroPress,
9:00
you're gonna push that liquid through
9:02
the bed of coffee at the end.
9:04
It was still an infusion.
9:05
Any pour-over I would recommend about 60 grams a liter.
9:09
Any infusion brew, I'd recommend about 75 grams a liter.
9:12
I think those are both great starting points,
9:14
but they're not the answer.
9:16
Don't take it as gospel.
9:17
Find your own way.
9:19
Find your own preferences.
9:20
If they are too weak too strong, well change them.
9:23
Being consistent in how you brew,
9:26
and that means weighing the amount of coffee going in
9:27
and ideally weighing the amount of water too
9:30
means that you actually understand what's affecting
9:32
your morning coffee.
9:33
You don't have to make decisions,
9:35
you don't have to guesstimate the amount
9:37
of water you poured in or the amount of coffee
9:39
you're brewing, especially frankly,
9:41
before you've had coffee.
9:43
So, get a set of scales.
9:45
This is a great starting point.
9:47
I'd love to hear what you're brewing at home.
9:49
I'd love also to hear more about your journey.
9:51
Has this changed for you over time?
9:53
Have you gone weaker?
9:54
Have you gone stronger?
9:55
Are you kinda bouncing around all over the place.
9:57
I'd be really interested to hear what you're doing.
10:00
As always, thank you so much for watching.
10:03
I hope you have a great day.
10:21
Dammit.
0:15
Welcome to today's video and the beginning
0:17
of a series of sorts, "A Beginner's Guide to Coffee."
0:20
And this video is the beginner's guide to coffee buying.
0:23
Now I know you know how to buy coffee
0:26
but what today's video is all about is helping you explore
0:28
the world of coffee more easily, more enjoyably,
0:32
with less mistakes.
0:33
Here's the thing.
0:34
If you have found a coffee that you love
0:36
be it a coffee roaster or a coffee brand, that's great.
0:39
I don't want you to stop drinking that thing.
0:40
I'm not going to tell you what to drink today.
0:43
But part of the joy of coffee is the diversity of flavor
0:45
and whatever you're enjoying now,
0:47
there's something, something out there
0:49
that I think you could enjoy even more.
0:52
But what I don't need to do is experiment, gamble,
0:55
buy something that kind of looks good and then hate it.
0:58
That's the goal today, help you buy stuff
1:00
that you're likely to really enjoy and avoid stuff
1:02
that you're likely to really dislike.
1:04
We're gonna break this down into three sections.
1:06
Part one is going to be the golden rules of buying coffee.
1:10
Part two will be where to buy coffee,
1:12
and the pros and cons of each.
1:13
And then part three will be about kind of decoding
1:16
a bag of coffee, decoding the label on a bag of coffee.
1:19
What are they trying to tell you?
1:20
And how do you match that
1:21
and marry that up to what you want?
1:23
Before we begin, I should disclose a couple
1:25
of very important ways in which I am biased.
1:27
Firstly, I have a strong preference
1:29
and I'm a big advocate for specialty coffee.
1:32
If you're watching this and you don't like specialty coffee,
1:34
that's okay, this is still a useful video for you,
1:37
but just know that I have a very strong
1:38
preference towards it.
1:39
Secondly, I also co-own a coffee company.
1:42
Now none of our products are in the video today,
1:44
there are no links to our products
1:45
in the description down below, but you should know
1:48
and I should disclose this right at the start.
1:50
So let's begin.
1:51
The golden rules for buying coffee.
1:53
And the first one you probably know, buy fresh.
1:57
But what does fresh mean?
1:59
Now coffee, after roasting declines in a pretty steady way
2:02
over time, it loses its aromatics,
2:04
they kind of float off into the atmosphere and escape
2:06
and you also develop some unpleasant flavors
2:09
things go stale and they begin to oxidize.
2:11
And so a combination of those things is what happens
2:14
when coffee stales and goes off.
2:16
It's food safe for a really, really long time.
2:19
Some of you might have seen I've drunk
2:20
coffee from the 1950s and while I wouldn't necessarily
2:23
recommend it, yeah, coffee lasts a really, really long time
2:27
but it's not at its best.
2:29
Now typically coffee will be dated
2:31
in one of two different ways.
2:33
Specialty coffee typically will offer you a roast date,
2:36
the date on which it was roasted.
2:38
And that's pretty useful.
2:39
You know how old the coffee is, exactly.
2:41
However, if you're selling a product through a supermarket,
2:44
supermarkets don't want you to put a roast date on there.
2:47
They hate roast dates.
2:48
They want a best before date.
2:50
This is often 12, even 18 sometimes 24 months
2:54
after the roasting date.
2:55
So you don't really know when the coffee was roasted.
2:59
This is not a choice that the roasters get to make, really,
3:01
this is a choice from supermarkets.
3:03
In fact, here on the table I've got the same coffee,
3:05
one from a supermarket and this has a best before date
3:10
and the same roaster, same coffee bought directly from them
3:14
has a roasted on date.
3:15
So understand this is a little bit confusing,
3:18
where you buy it will impact the information that you have.
3:20
More on that a little bit later on.
3:22
Today we're gonna cover coffees
3:23
for both filter coffee drinking and for espresso.
3:26
And what gets confusing about the messaging of fresh,
3:29
is that fresh isn't always the best.
3:32
Now when you roast coffee, a lot of CO2 comes out.
3:34
That's why any bag of coffee will have a little valve
3:36
on it that you can squeeze the gas out off.
3:38
Now when it comes to espresso in particular,
3:40
fresher isn't always better.
3:42
Because there's a lot of CO2 in very fresh coffee beans,
3:45
when you try and brew them as espresso
3:46
a lot of gas comes out in this pressurized environment
3:49
and it can make for a disrupted brewing process.
3:52
It's harder to brew really really fresh coffee
3:54
and many people rest the coffee
3:56
for seven to 10 days, sometimes two weeks
3:59
if not sometimes longer to make it
4:01
a little easier to brew for espresso.
4:03
With filter coffee, it's less of a concern.
4:05
A day or two fine, you know, it's pretty easy
4:07
to brew from that point onwards,
4:09
it gets a little bit easier, the older it is
4:11
when you're trying to hit a kind
4:12
of window of anywhere from a week to six weeks
4:15
in which it's going to be at its best.
4:16
And speaking of at its best, we need to talk
4:19
also about ground coffee versus whole bean.
4:22
I will always, always, always advocate
4:24
for whole bean coffee for a couple of reasons.
4:26
Firstly, it's better value for money.
4:28
With ground coffee, they'll often pack
4:30
it in a protective atmosphere, but once you open that bag
4:32
and air gets in, the clock's ticking
4:34
and you might have one or two days
4:36
to enjoy it at its best.
4:38
Yes, it's still drinkable yeah, it's probably okay
4:40
for a little while more but you're
4:42
not getting what you paid for.
4:44
Whole beans last much longer,
4:45
and when you grind them they begin to degrade
4:47
but if you grind before you use them
4:49
you're just going to have a better time.
4:50
It's better value for money to buy whole beans.
4:53
And secondly, grinding coffee is one
4:55
of the great pleasures of life.
4:57
You know, I don't want people to miss out
4:58
on having their morning be
4:59
that little bit more aromatic and enjoyable.
5:02
As final guidance for whole bean coffee,
5:04
anything that's a kind of light, medium roast
5:06
I think is generally fine four to six to eight weeks
5:10
after roasting depending on how you're storing it.
5:12
If it's pre-ground, it's not going to be that case
5:14
and if it's a darker roast, I would say
5:16
maybe four to six weeks maximum
5:18
cause dark roads go stale a little bit quicker.
5:21
The second rule I'm going to give you
5:22
is to buy traceable coffee.
5:24
Buy coffee from a as distinct a place as you can.
5:27
That might be a single farm.
5:29
That might be a cooperative of growers.
5:31
That might be a region in some cases, but historically
5:35
coffee was just sold by country of origin.
5:37
And you'd be skeptical if the wine you bought on the shelf
5:40
just said, France, that's not enough, right?
5:43
You would want more.
5:44
Which region is this from at the very least,
5:47
same with coffee.
5:48
Just because the coffee is from Guatemala or Colombia.
5:51
Well, it doesn't really tell you that much
5:53
about how it's going to taste.
5:54
There's huge variation within just about
5:56
every single origin of flavor, of styles,
5:59
so knowing what country it's from, isn't that useful to you.
6:04
It's a little useful, but it's not that useful.
6:06
If you can't tell where in a country a coffee is from
6:09
it's not particularly traceable.
6:11
Now the secrets of shortcut of traceable coffees is
6:14
that adding traceability to a coffee
6:16
keeping it separate all the way
6:17
from a farm or a co-op to you, the consumer, costs money.
6:22
It adds costs to that product.
6:24
And that will only be done in situations
6:26
where that coffee is good enough in terms of its taste
6:28
and its quality to merit a premium price.
6:31
There's no point keeping a coffee
6:33
that doesn't taste very good traceable all the way through
6:35
because it doesn't have the value necessary
6:37
to kind of return on that investment.
6:40
So that's why traceability I think,
6:42
is a nice little shortcut to quality.
6:44
I don't want to tell you how much to spend on coffee
6:46
but I would say that spending more buys you generally
6:49
better quality, better tasting coffee,
6:51
and more of that money is likely
6:52
to go back to the producer.
6:54
So I'd obviously encourage you to invest
6:56
a little bit in the coffee that you drink.
6:57
This last tip, it's already optional,
6:59
but it's kind of complicated tip,
7:01
and that's to buy seasonally.
7:03
Here's the deal, different countries around the world
7:05
harvest coffee at different times.
7:07
This means that the raw coffees are arriving
7:09
into kind of consuming countries at different times of year.
7:12
Raw coffee lasts longer generally than roasted coffee.
7:16
And a roaster may carry a coffee from anywhere
7:18
from a few weeks to six to eight months.
7:21
Classically, roasters would carry
7:23
a coffee all year round, right?
7:25
They would have a Guatemalan offering 12 months of the year
7:28
even though for, three, four, sometimes five months,
7:31
that coffee wasn't very good because
7:33
the raw coffee was a little bit old.
7:35
Specialty has embraced the seasonality,
7:37
which means that you may only see coffees
7:39
from certain origins for six months of the year.
7:41
I'm not going to ask you to pay attention
7:43
to which country is harvesting when
7:45
or understand shipping dates or that kind of stuff
7:47
but do look to buy from places
7:50
where the offering changes reasonably regularly.
7:53
If they're doing that, if they have different products
7:54
on the shelf quite often,
7:56
while that can be initially frustrating
7:58
it's actually a good thing.
7:59
It means that the raw coffees are nice and fresh
8:01
and you're going to get the best possible experience.
8:04
Now let's talk about where to buy coffee.
8:07
For this I'm going to say there are three
8:08
kind of places to buy coffee.
8:10
One is the supermarket, two would be a cafe or coffee shop
8:14
or a shop on the high street let's say,
8:16
or in your neighborhood.
8:17
And the third place would be online.
8:20
We need to talk about each of these
8:21
because they impact the offering and your options
8:24
and the way you should approach buying in those places.
8:27
So let's start with the supermarket, right?
8:29
It has a couple of big advantages.
8:30
Firstly, for most people, it's incredibly convenient.
8:33
They're often visiting or buying from supermarket online
8:36
or you know, it's a part of your week.
8:38
It's part of your kind of routine day to day
8:40
and secondly, things there are generally cheaper.
8:43
Supermarkets compete with each other.
8:45
They're happy to use their size
8:47
and their scale to diminish their profits.
8:49
And so typically products in the supermarket
8:51
are as cheap as they're likely to be anywhere.
8:54
That's the good news.
8:55
Here's the bad news.
8:56
Supermarkets do not treat coffee like fresh food.
8:59
As I said before, they don't want you to think
9:01
about when that coffee was roasted because you might pick
9:04
up a bag and think, "Oh, this is two months old."
9:07
But if they give you a best before date,
9:09
well you might think, "Oh, I've got 10 months left
9:11
"to use this product."
9:13
The way supermarkets work is that they may buy
9:15
from a single supplier that goes into
9:16
a centralized distribution center that eventually goes
9:19
to the individual supermarket, goes onto the shelf
9:21
works its way slowly forwards to the front of the shelf
9:24
and it can take months from it being produced
9:26
to it being sold.
9:28
So freshness is really, really, really difficult.
9:31
You can buy good quality traceable coffee there,
9:34
well roasted coffees that I would say are good coffees,
9:37
definitely worth drinking
9:38
but know that the trade-off is freshness.
9:41
So now let's talk about coffee shops.
9:43
And right now, as coffee shops around the world
9:45
begin to reopen in many places,
9:47
this is a great way to support them.
9:48
I just wanna put that out there now.
9:50
Now coffee shops have some advantages.
9:52
One, you often go to them.
9:53
So there's a convenience factor there.
9:55
Two, there's the opportunity for a conversation.
9:58
You can talk to someone and say, I like this kind of coffee.
10:01
This is a brand I like or this is an experience I had
10:03
that I liked, what can you recommend?
10:05
And a good coffee shop should be able to help you.
10:07
Now in terms of freshness, their product
10:09
typically will be actually pretty fresh.
10:11
It may not be as fresh as buying online
10:13
and we'll come to that in a second.
10:15
But if you need coffee to use right now,
10:18
coffee shops are perfect.
10:19
Chances are that coffee is five, six,
10:22
seven days old and they certainly will have
10:23
something that old that you can buy.
10:25
It's beautifully fresh, perfectly ready to brew
10:28
and you can take it home and have a delicious cup of coffee.
10:30
Oh, wait, one more thing.
10:31
Don't forget that coffee shops
10:32
are often serving the coffee they retail.
10:34
You know, there may be an opportunity to try
10:37
before you buy it, taste something or buy something,
10:39
drink it, really enjoy it, go back
10:41
and take a bag of that home to enjoy in the morning.
10:43
Big fan of buying from coffee shops.
10:46
Let's talk about online.
10:48
Now online gives you probably the most variety.
10:50
It's often competitive in price.
10:52
You're buying directly from a roaster
10:53
and that means in many cases, though not all,
10:56
but in many cases they will roast your coffee
10:58
once they receive your order
11:00
they'll ship it often the same day.
11:02
And it will come to you a day or two
11:04
after being roasted, incredibly fresh.
11:07
But like we said, fresher isn't always better.
11:09
If you're kind of managing the freshness
11:11
and you know, you've got like a week left on this bag,
11:14
great time to buy online.
11:15
You know, that's a good decision.
11:17
It'll come, it'll be nicely rested.
11:18
You can go into that bag next, life is easy.
11:21
But it requires a touch more organization.
11:23
Now often roasters will offer things
11:25
like subscription services.
11:26
I think those are generally a great way to go.
11:29
It sort of takes away having to remember to do something.
11:32
Coffee just arrives through your door.
11:34
That I think is a great thing to do.
11:36
And often for many people they'll go
11:38
through more than one bag of month.
11:39
And so a great way to set up life is to have one bag
11:41
come on a subscription from a roaster
11:43
and then buy one bag on top of it from a different place,
11:46
from a cafe or from wherever.
11:48
Because the whole point that I keep coming back to
11:50
is that coffee is really, really fun
11:52
and tasting different stuff is really, really fun.
11:55
So those are my recommendations and those are the impacts
11:58
of buying on each of those different places.
12:00
Now, before we move into the third section
12:01
where we decode a bag of coffee,
12:52
So let's talk about all of these bags of coffee here
12:55
and work out what they're trying to tell us
12:57
about how they taste.
12:58
Now to kind of get a wide coverage of coffee
13:00
for the video today it required a trip to the supermarket,
13:03
which is always good for me to go back
13:05
and look at that enormous wall of choice
13:07
and try and work out what I wanted to buy.
13:10
And that's kind of what we're thinking about here, right?
13:12
You walk up to that big wall of coffee.
13:14
You pick up a bag and you're like, will I like this?
13:16
So the first thing we're going to talk about
13:19
is going to be roast degree.
13:20
How darkly a coffee is roasted.
13:22
Generally we talk about either light or medium or dark.
13:25
And in the case of supermarket coffees
13:27
often they don't use that language.
13:29
Often they use strength,
13:31
they'll say strength five, strength three.
13:34
Now they don't generally put anything down
13:36
as strength one or two because no one wants weak coffee.
13:39
So the functional range is generally three through five
13:41
which is kind of absurd, but it is what it is.
13:44
Now, specialty coffee gets very angry
13:46
about the use of the word strength
13:47
on the front of a bag because strength means something else.
13:50
Strength is how much coffee to how much water,
13:52
you know, I mean the more coffee you use to brew a cup,
13:55
the stronger that's going to be.
13:56
That's the correct usage of strength,
13:58
but in the defense of the supermarket coffees,
14:00
at least they're trying to properly communicate
14:02
roasted degree to some extent for people.
14:05
Specialty coffee often does not describe roast degree.
14:09
Now it does, occasionally, there's a bag here
14:11
that has along the bottom here, medium roast, right?
14:14
That's nice but that's not common in specialty coffee.
14:18
The most common thing to see is a description
14:21
about whether it might be used as a filter coffee
14:23
or as an espresso coffee.
14:25
Now, when it comes to the term roasted for espresso
14:28
that tells you a little bit regarding the coffee
14:31
from that particular roaster, right?
14:33
Most roasters will roast their espresso sort
14:35
of focused products, a little bit darker,
14:38
a little bit deeper than they would do
14:39
their filter coffee roasted product.
14:41
However, some people in specialty
14:42
use what's called an omni-roast
14:44
where they're kind of roasting for both at the same time.
14:47
It's a kind of philosophy thing for many roasters
14:49
their approach to espresso, to filter coffee,
14:51
to roasting as a whole but if you are buying
14:54
specialty coffee and it does not have any indication
14:58
of roast on it, it is a light to medium roast.
15:01
That's the default.
15:02
On the occasions that they don't roast that way,
15:04
they tend to signify that.
15:06
If there's a description of roast,
15:07
be it a country description which doesn't really
15:09
mean anything like French roast, or just dark roast,
15:12
then you know, it's different
15:13
but otherwise you can presume it
15:15
to be light to medium roasted.
15:17
With the supermarket stuff the higher the strength,
15:19
the darker the roast and generally speaking,
15:21
the lighter the roast of coffee, the more acidity will have,
15:24
the darker the roast the more bitterness it will have
15:26
and the less acidity it will have.
15:28
And, you know, specialty feels that light to medium
15:30
gives you a nice sweetness a little bit of acidity,
15:33
not too much bitterness and tons and tons of flavor
15:35
of where the coffee comes from which is why
15:37
that's such a popular roasting style choice
15:39
for specialty companies.
15:41
Now, we need to talk about the descriptors,
15:44
and generally specialty companies and in fact,
15:46
more and more commercial companies will offer you
15:48
maybe three sometimes more descriptive words.
15:51
Now these are doing two different jobs
15:53
and I think people can forget about this.
15:55
Firstly, they are trying to describe
15:57
in some way the taste of the coffee.
15:59
And secondly, they're trying to entice you,
16:02
the buyer, to buy that bag of coffee.
16:04
It's half use and it's half sales.
16:07
And it's important to remember that.
16:08
In some cases descriptions can be so odd or unusual
16:11
or kind of contrary and clashing
16:13
that that really doesn't work.
16:15
But in many cases it does
16:16
and things sound completely delicious.
16:19
Those words promise a great deal.
16:20
If you tell me my coffee is going to taste of caramel,
16:23
well I expect it to taste almost
16:25
as if you've put caramel in the bag.
16:27
And it leads to further confusion with the consumer
16:29
who thinks, "Oh, is this like a flavored coffee?"
16:31
"Is this like a caramel flavored coffee?"
16:34
Because those exist, but often, no, it's not.
16:37
They're trying to communicate something about
16:39
the coffee's tastes to you with that word.
16:42
And we'll come to that a bit more very soon.
16:44
One other quick tip, specialty coffee
16:46
is a little bit like wine, except for one thing,
16:48
the very highest priced wines are often the most elegant
16:52
the most kind of classic, the most beautiful wines
16:54
but they would be familiar and enjoyable to most people.
16:57
The highest price coffees tend to be the most unusual,
17:00
the least kind of coffee-tasting coffees.
17:03
So it's just one to bear in mind.
17:04
If you're looking at a more expensive coffee
17:06
have a look at those words, are they promising you
17:08
a very unusual experience?
17:10
And is that what you want?
17:11
And in some cases, yes it is.
17:12
And in other cases, no, it's not.
17:14
One of the things to bear in mind is
17:16
that often these roasters come up with their descriptions
17:18
for coffees through comparative tasting.
17:19
They're not just tasting that one coffee on its own.
17:22
They're comparing it to other coffees
17:24
that they're also roasting and serving.
17:26
Now we've talked a lot on this channel
17:27
about learning to taste, there's some information up here
17:29
if you want to develop your tasting skills,
17:32
but comparative tasting is really useful
17:34
for kind of breaking apart the flavors of coffee.
17:36
But if you, the consumer don't have
17:38
that comparative tasting experience when you drink it,
17:41
it can feel harder to pull out the berry-qualities
17:44
of a coffee or the kind of ripe pear
17:46
promised by the roaster.
17:48
But if you were comparing it to something else,
17:50
oh, the differences would be more obvious.
17:53
And yeah, this is kind of more pear-like
17:55
in its way in its flavor, compared to coffee B or C or D.
17:58
So know that there is an element of frustration
18:01
that's almost inevitable because you won't have had
18:03
the same comparative experience as a coffee roaster,
18:07
but generally they're doing their best to broadcast
18:09
some key information to you to help you really find out
18:12
if you're going to enjoy that coffee or not.
18:14
Now, what I can't do is know what your personal preferences
18:18
are around, what you really, really like.
18:20
What I can do, however is understand some things that you
18:24
really really dislike and give you some guidance there.
18:27
There are three categories of kind of coffee experience
18:29
that really trigger dislike for people.
18:33
I'll explain.
18:34
Some people cannot stand it when a coffee
18:36
is quite light bodied, quite delicate quite tea-like almost,
18:39
it doesn't taste like coffee to them.
18:41
And I want to help you avoid buying coffees like that
18:44
if you feel that way.
18:45
Now, generally specialty coffee is often of a certain roast
18:48
degree as we said, it's a kind of light to medium roast
18:50
and the kinds of coffees that are typically bought
18:52
by specialty companies are often as a default
18:56
kind of medium bodied.
18:58
Generally they'll use language to highlight
19:00
the texture of the coffee if it is not
19:02
a kind of medium bodied coffee,
19:04
if it's quite light bodied, look for words they'll use
19:06
like delicate or elegant or often explicitly
19:09
tea-like, like look for descriptions of things
19:11
being quite floral.
19:12
You know, those kinds of words suggest lightness to you.
19:15
And that's what they're trying to say.
19:17
And if they use kind of creamy or rich
19:20
or those kinds of words then they're suggesting
19:23
there's a fuller full-bodied coffee in that way.
19:25
But if there's no texture words, I would say
19:28
as a kind of vaguely useful rule,
19:30
it's a medium bodied coffee.
19:31
Now the second one I think is a much easier one to decode.
19:35
And it's a much bigger love/hate aspect
19:37
for a lot of people with the coffee they drink,
19:39
and that is the sensation of acidity.
19:41
Some people do not want any acidity in their coffee.
19:44
The idea of an acidic coffee is genuinely repulsive
19:47
to them and that's completely okay.
19:49
There are other people who want
19:50
all the acidity in their coffee.
19:51
They want it to be bright and juicy and vibrant.
19:54
How do we help you there?
19:56
Well, it's going to be fruit-words.
19:58
If you see fresh fruit words in the descriptors,
20:01
there may be berries, there might be apple, right?
20:04
Those kinds of fruit descriptors.
20:06
If they're referring to fresh fruits,
20:08
that coffee is going to have a reasonable amount of acidity.
20:11
If you see berry fruits, I'd expect a lot of acidity.
20:13
If you see citrus fruits, I'd expect a lot of acidity.
20:16
If you see things like apple or pear,
20:18
yeah, I would expect a good amount of acidity.
20:21
If the words are fruit words but they're
20:23
kind of transformed, if they're cooked fruit words
20:24
if it's described as jammy or candied orange, for example
20:28
then I would expect a little acidity, but not a lot.
20:31
If a description has no fruit words
20:34
then I would expect very low acidity from it.
20:36
If they're using other words like caramel
20:38
or treacle or nuts or chocolate, those are non-fruit words
20:43
and they are suggesting low acidity in that regard.
20:45
So that will you kind of decode how much acidity
20:49
do I generally expect?
20:50
The third kind of key aspect around sort of love/hate
20:53
with coffee is what I would call fermented fruit flavors.
20:56
That sounds a bit odd, but there are styles of coffee
20:59
they're often dry or natural process coffees
21:01
where the whole cherry was dried in the sun
21:04
instead of the seeds being squeezed out and sort of washed
21:06
and kind of cleaned of their fruit before being dried.
21:09
If it's been dried inside the fruit
21:10
then a little fermentation can go on
21:12
and you can get these kind of funky
21:14
very unusual flavors that are often described
21:16
on bags of coffee as tropical fruit.
21:19
If you see pineapple, if you see mango
21:21
if you see strawberry, even chances are there's
21:24
going to be some fermented fruit qualities
21:26
to the coffee in the bag.
21:27
If it says dry process or natural process on the bag,
21:31
expect those flavors.
21:32
Now, some people love those flavors.
21:34
They are fascinating.
21:36
They are unlike any other coffee flavors.
21:38
They are easily identifiable.
21:39
They're just kind of fun.
21:40
Other people are completely disgusted by them
21:43
and they hate them, for that reason,
21:44
it's really important to me
21:46
that people understand and how to not buy those
21:48
or to buy those on purpose and never make a mistake.
21:51
If you don't like fermented fruit flavors.
21:52
And that in my experience is around 40% of people
21:56
then I would strongly avoid dry or natural process coffees
21:59
unless they're making a lot of promises
22:01
around how clean it tastes.
22:02
There's no weird fruit flavors on the bag.
22:04
If they're saying it's just like clean
22:05
or sweet or chocolate on nuts, maybe,
22:08
but if there's any kind of fruit on there,
22:10
chances are that's not going to be to your tastes
22:12
and it's just a bit of a gamble, which I want you to avoid.
22:15
Now I've talked a lot about the sort of theory side.
22:18
The reason I bought a bunch of coffee
22:19
is to use some sort of practical examples here, right?
22:22
Let's take what we've discussed so far
22:25
and apply it to some real world examples.
22:27
This is a Kenyan coffee.
22:29
It's from the supermarket, strength three.
22:31
So it's going to be the lighter roast
22:32
that you would get at a supermarket.
22:34
Cause two in one don't really exist.
22:36
It's saying zesty, citrus, and blackberry.
22:39
They are broadcasting to you that this is
22:41
is going to be a light to medium bodied coffee.
22:44
It's going to have, for them, a lot of acidity
22:46
but those fruits are kind of clean fruit tastes with it.
22:49
It's not kind of funky fruit.
22:51
That's what they're telling you about this coffee.
22:53
And from that perspective, you may love
22:54
or loathe the experience that is coming.
22:56
(beans rattling) Now, this Lavazza Rossa,
22:58
very popular with a lot of people
22:59
description, rich and full bodied with chocolate notes.
23:02
So they're saying to you, this is
23:04
a heavy bodied coffee, right?
23:06
There's going to be very little acidity.
23:07
There's no fruit words in here whatsoever.
23:09
So they're saying no to low acidity
23:11
lots and lots of body, lots of texture.
23:14
They're saying intensity five out of 10, roasting medium.
23:17
So you're not expecting a ton of kind of bitterness
23:19
or kind of harsher more kind of developed roast flavors
23:23
but it's still going to be a big
23:24
kind of heavy-bodied experience.
23:26
Back to this bag which I picked up before.
23:28
It's a coffee from China, which is interesting.
23:30
Now this is described as kind of nutty and sweet here.
23:32
They say cherry, almond, candied orange and caramel, right?
23:36
It's a medium roast.
23:38
So what I'm expecting is reasonable texture actually
23:41
like some nice body, it's a washed coffee
23:43
but I wouldn't expect it to be light-bodied.
23:46
In addition, it has some fruit, but they're pushing
23:48
towards kind of cooked fruit, candied fruit in a way.
23:50
So I would expect some acidity, but not that much.
23:54
And I wouldn't expect any fermented flavors in this
23:56
from their particular description.
23:58
So, you know, I can kind of understand
24:00
am I likely to enjoy this, or am I not?
24:02
So this one is really interesting to me
24:04
because this is a very big coffee company
24:06
called Taylors of Harrogate, very large UK company,
24:09
one of the biggest roasters in the UK
24:10
doing specialty coffee.
24:12
Now there's is listed right in the front as a natural.
24:14
So straightaway, we know we're in for some funky flavors.
24:16
We look at the back of the bag.
24:18
Yeah, it says pineapple, coconut and whiskey.
24:21
This is going to be a strongly fermented tasting coffee.
24:25
Right, it says natural process.
24:27
It's roasted for filter, it tells us that.
24:29
And it also says it's a light roast.
24:30
So we've got a lot of information.
24:32
Natural process coffees don't often have the same acidity
24:35
as washed coffees, but still, if you don't like acidity
24:38
they're saying probably avoid this coffee.
24:39
And if you don't like fermented flavors
24:41
then probably avoid this coffee.
24:42
But if you like those two things
24:44
this might be a pretty safe bet.
24:46
If you know, if you're buying it off the shelf
24:48
especially if you're spending a little bit of money.
24:50
Now, in some cases you may not have any descriptors on a bag
24:53
but generally speaking specialty roasters are wise enough
24:57
to the whole fermented flavors thing
24:58
that they will say if it's a natural or not.
25:00
And so here we know that it is an natural process coffee.
25:03
So from that word alone you can make
25:05
a pretty informed decision around your preferences
25:07
around those styles or flavors.
25:09
And then one more, one more.
25:11
So here, it's an espresso roast.
25:12
So we'd expect it to be darker
25:14
and it is strength four suggesting
25:16
it's going to be pretty darkly roasted,
25:18
not all the way to very dark roasted
25:19
but pretty dark, descriptors of rich chocolate,
25:22
spice and toffee, so no fruit words there whatsoever.
25:26
We're gonna expect really pretty low acidity
25:29
they're offering, you know, by the description
25:31
some kind of sweetness there, but ultimately
25:33
it's not going to be a, you know a fruity
25:36
or in any way, acidic espresso.
25:38
I think it's going to be more kind of medium bodied
25:41
but relatively high bitterness and low acid.
25:44
That's the sort of subtext of this whole thing.
25:46
So that I hope is a really useful guide
25:48
to help you buy better coffees.
25:50
But now I want to hear from you down in the comments below,
25:53
what did I miss out on?
25:54
What more information would be useful to you
25:56
when it comes to buying a bag of coffee
25:58
and feeling confident that you're really going to enjoy it?
26:02
Let me know down in the comments below,
26:04
but for now I'll say thank you so much for watching.
26:07
And I hope you have a great day.
0:20
Welcome to today's video, which is a beginner's guide
0:23
to coffee grinders.
0:24
Because there's a lot of different coffee grinders out there
0:27
which is the right one for you?
0:28
Which one meets your needs?
0:29
Which is the best value for money?
0:31
Now, what we're gonna do today
0:33
is cover a little bit of theory at the start
0:35
on coffee grinding, right?
0:36
Understanding what's going on,
0:38
why it's something worth worrying about,
0:40
why it's something we're spending money
0:42
on a bit of equipment to do it.
0:43
And then in the second half,
0:45
we'll talk through all of these grinders here
0:48
and talk through the features that you get,
0:50
what happens when you spend more money
0:52
and you, I hope at the end of it,
0:54
will feel well-equipped
0:55
to buy a coffee grinder that meets your needs
0:57
and have even better tasting coffee every morning.
1:00
One quick thing,
1:00
I'm not gonna necessarily recommend specific models,
1:03
nor review specific models in this video.
1:06
Where I've talked about grinders before
1:08
they'll be links down in the description,
1:09
you can watch those.
1:10
I've done a number of different videos
1:12
on particular grinders.
1:13
Today, these are kind of representative grinders
1:16
of different technologies or different features
1:18
just to kind of explain what's happening
1:21
when you spend more money.
1:22
But let's start with the theory.
1:24
Let's start with what happens when we grind coffee.
1:26
Why we grind coffee in the first place.
1:28
Now our whole coffee bean is a wonderful thing,
1:30
but it doesn't make a good tasting coffee.
1:32
Water cannot get to all of the flavor
1:35
'cause it could only sort of get
1:36
to the very outside of the bean.
1:37
And so if you put whole beans in hot water
1:39
some flavor will come out, but really not very much.
1:43
And so we grind it, we smash it into little tiny pieces
1:46
because what we're concerned about first and foremost
1:48
is exposing sort of more surface area.
1:51
And the finer you grind anything,
1:52
the more surface area that you have,
1:54
and the easier it is for the water to get in there,
1:56
dissolve the flavor out, get it into your cup of coffee
1:58
and for you to have a better
1:59
more delicious cup at the end of it.
2:01
Now, one of the big sells you'll hear
2:02
for a coffee grinder is that freshness
2:05
is actually a really key aspect of grinding coffee.
2:07
And that's true, when you smash coffee,
2:09
you expose all of the surface area
2:11
and it means everything that you've exposed
2:13
can begin to go stale.
2:15
And there are three ways in which coffee goes stale.
2:17
The first and to me kind of saddest
2:19
is the idea that you just lose those flavors.
2:21
They go, what's called volatilely,
2:23
float off into the atmosphere
2:24
and those flavors and aromas essentially wander off.
2:27
You'll smell them for a minute
2:28
and then you won't get to drink them later.
2:30
So that's kind of a thing.
2:31
So the older coffee is the more flavor
2:33
essentially just loses to the air, to the atmosphere.
2:36
The second thing that happens
2:37
is that you have what are called sort of staling reactions
2:39
where different compounds combine with each other
2:41
and begin to create new flavors
2:44
that often aren't particularly nice.
2:46
And so after a little while
2:47
your coffee will taste measurably worse
2:49
as well as being less interesting.
2:51
And then the third thing is oxidation.
2:53
And that'll happen to sort of some of the fats
2:55
and oils inside coffee,
2:57
they will oxidize and essentially begin to go rancid.
3:00
It's not a great smell or taste rancid oil,
3:02
and rancid oil in all forms smells a little bit fishy
3:05
and that's true with coffee.
3:06
So very old, very stale, rancid coffee
3:09
is not something I would recommend.
3:11
And the best way to avoid all of those things
3:13
is really only to smash the coffee bean to pieces
3:16
when you want to immediately then brew it,
3:18
that way you capture a lot more flavor,
3:20
you have less loss of quality,
3:22
it's just a better time all around.
3:24
Now occasionally on the internet
3:25
you'll see a thing that says pre-ground coffee
3:27
from a very, very, very good commercial grinder
3:30
will make better coffee in many cases,
3:32
than fresh ground coffee
3:33
from a very cheap coffee grinder.
3:35
And that's an interesting test and study that was done.
3:38
I think it ignores some of the other reasons
3:41
to buy a coffee grinder.
3:42
We'll get to in a second,
3:43
but really what isn't to be underestimated
3:46
is just the pleasure of grinding coffee.
3:48
In that moment, there is an enormous release
3:50
of smell that is fantastic.
3:52
That moment of grinding coffee
3:54
bit in the morning, first thing, or in the afternoon
3:57
it's a pleasure not to be missed.
3:58
So from that perspective alone,
4:00
a coffee grinder is worth having.
4:02
And if you own a pepper grinder of any kind,
4:04
then you owe it to yourself to own a coffee grinder too,
4:07
if you drink coffee.
4:08
Now, the second thing that gets talked about a lot
4:10
is called grind uniformity.
4:12
And that's the idea that when you grind coffee,
4:14
ideally, the little pieces that you make
4:16
should all be the same size.
4:17
Because when you come to prepare them later,
4:20
brew them into a cup of coffee,
4:21
the more uniform the size is, the better
4:23
they'll give up their flavor in a more uniform way.
4:26
And that makes sense from anything in the kitchen
4:28
if you're trying to cook some potatoes,
4:30
if you cook a little tiny piece of potato
4:32
and a whole potato, they'll cook at very different rates
4:34
and they probably won't cook well together.
4:36
Same thing with coffee grinding, right?
4:38
If you are trying to brew loads of little tiny pieces
4:40
of coffee, alongside loads of very big pieces of coffee,
4:44
you'll get a lot of flavor out of the tiny pieces
4:46
and not very much out of the other pieces.
4:48
And this can result in a very unbalanced,
4:50
unpleasant cup of coffee.
4:52
Those tiny pieces can add some bitterness,
4:54
those giant pieces can add some sourness,
4:57
and those two things combined
4:59
are not how I wanna start my day.
5:00
So as we talk through grinders
5:01
you'll hear me reference this idea of grind uniformity.
5:04
And it is important,
5:06
it helps you make better tasting coffee
5:08
to have the pieces be a very similar size.
5:10
You'll have less unbalanced, less unpleasant cups of coffee,
5:14
more delicious cups of coffee.
5:15
Now the third aspect of coffee grinders
5:17
that's very important of coffee grinding
5:19
that's very important is grind size control.
5:21
The ideal grind size for espresso
5:23
is very different from the ideal grind size
5:25
for something like a French press, for example, right?
5:27
With espresso, you want lots and lots
5:29
of very fine small pieces
5:31
because you're gonna extract that coffee
5:33
with very little liquid to make it very strong.
5:35
With a French press, you might wanna grind it
5:37
a little bit coarser.
5:38
So being able to control the grind size
5:40
is really, really, really important,
5:42
particularly so in espresso,
5:44
but we'll touch on that a little bit later.
5:46
So that's it, that's the key information
5:48
to think about as we go into looking
5:49
at these different grinders,
5:51
it'll help us to understand
5:52
why you might wanna spend a bit more money here or there.
5:54
But before we get into that, there's a quick ad

Thank you to Skillshare for sponsoring this video.
6:43
So let's start with these 10 grinders in front of me.
6:45
Let's start at the beginning
6:46
with the cheapest grinder on offer,
6:48
which is this it's a blade grinder.
6:50
And these can be had for like 20 pounds,
6:51
they're very cheap, they're very simple things.
6:53
You've got a little motor
6:55
and that's attached to some spinning blades inside here.
6:58
And when you turn the grinder on
6:59
they spin really, really quickly
7:00
and essentially those blades, they're not really sharp
7:03
they kind of just smash the coffee down into little pieces.
7:06
The longer you run it, the finer the coffee will be.
7:08
But the problem with these,
7:10
is that you really don't have any control
7:14
meaningfully over grind size.
7:15
To have really the same grind size
7:17
every time is quite tricky,
7:18
and to have a uniform grind size is extremely unlikely.
7:21
This kind of act of violence
7:23
of just smashing the coffee beans instead of cutting them
7:26
creates a lot of very fine pieces
7:27
that can add a lot of muddiness and bitterness
7:29
and kind of dullness to your cup of coffee in the morning.
7:33
I'm not saying you can't enjoy coffee
7:34
made with a blade grinder,
7:35
and there's some hacks you can do too
7:37
to improve the quality of its output
7:39
that's linked up here.
7:40
If you're enjoying coffee with a blade grinder now,
7:42
you could really, really be enjoying your coffee
7:44
a lot more with a better grinder
7:47
that offers you a little bit more control and uniformity.
7:49
If you own one of these and you're upgrading from it,
7:51
do not throw it away
7:52
they make for fantastic spice grinders,
7:55
they are useful to have around.
7:56
But to grind coffee
7:58
they are a little bit frustrating.
7:59
So then we move from what are called blade grinders
8:02
into the rest of these, which are called burr grinders.
8:04
So inside these, you've got two cutting discs,
8:07
one spins against the other
8:09
and controlling the distance between the two
8:11
controls how big the pieces are when they finally get out
8:13
of the grinder into the collection bin below
8:16
where you're gonna sort of take them
8:17
and then pour them into your brewery
8:18
or whatever you're gonna do with them.
8:19
This is a classic kind of entry-level hand grinder.
8:22
It's relatively cheap, it's about 40 pounds.
8:25
And a lot of people choose to start
8:26
their sort of grinding journey
8:28
here with one of these 'cause it's not a huge investment.
8:31
And that's true, you'll have some control
8:32
of the grind setting.
8:33
In something like this,
8:34
you kind of control the burr distance.
8:35
This is a conical burr grinder.
8:37
So you've got a kind of cone-shaped main burr
8:39
that spins inside this thing.
8:40
Conical burrs are popular and a lot of grinders
8:43
they have a larger cutting surface
8:45
which helps you to kind of grind more coffee
8:47
through kind of per turn, which is useful.
8:49
This is in contrast to what are called flat burr grinders.
8:52
We have two discs or rings of cutting teeth,
8:55
one spins against the other, same control mechanism
8:57
you just move them further apart
8:58
for a coarser grind or closer together for a finer grind.
9:00
Now the burrs and cheaper hand grinders especially
9:03
tend to be made of ceramic.
9:04
This is a cheaper material to produce.
9:07
They don't cut quite as cleanly.
9:08
So your grind uniformity isn't quite as good
9:11
as a metal burr,
9:12
but as an entry-level thing, they work okay.
9:15
What you tend to see also in cheaper burr grinders
9:18
is a little bit of wobbling
9:19
from that bottom burrs that's grinding.
9:20
'Cause it's not stabilized super well
9:22
because they're trying to keep costs down.
9:24
That will also result in a less uniform cup of coffee.
9:27
So if you look at going from say 40 pounds
9:29
up to 100 pounds, right?
9:33
You've got the same basic technology.
9:34
You're gonna be doing the work here.
9:35
You are turning, you're working to crush the coffee
9:39
between those burrs.
9:40
Now, here you go from a plastic construction
9:42
to a metal construction,
9:43
and you go from ceramic burrs to metal burrs.
9:46
So it's a big jump in quality
9:47
going from 40 pounds to say 100 pounds.
9:49
Now with the previous grinder
9:50
and this grinder and the next grinder too,
9:52
they are what's called stepped grinders,
9:54
where you adjust the grind here at the bottom
9:56
by fixed amounts.
9:58
This is sort of a step that kind of clicks into place.
10:01
And that's a controlled movement.
10:02
That means that you've got pretty good control
10:04
of a ground size, but not infinite control in a way.
10:07
And later on, we'll talk about stepless grinders.
10:09
But for the purposes here, steps work very well,
10:12
they're repeatable, they're useful to have.
10:14
This will do a better job grinding coffee
10:16
than the 40 pound grinder, by a good amount actually.
10:20
By not needing a motor, by having you do the hard work
10:23
you can kind of invest a bit more in the other things
10:25
like the burr quality and get better results for less money.
10:29
The downside of course, is that you have to do the grinding
10:32
every time, every morning.
10:34
And if you're growing a lot of coffee
10:35
that can take a while and it is hard work
10:38
grinding the coffee is relatively physical.
10:40
That can change with more expensive grinders
10:42
or bigger grinders,
10:43
but ultimately hand grinding
10:45
is something you have to kind of enjoy doing.
10:47
As you go from 100 pounds
10:48
up to something much more expensive
10:49
in the hand grinder world,
10:51
generally, you're getting an increase in construction.
10:53
Again, this is better made,
10:54
this feels solid, it's great materials,
10:57
but really you're could be paying
10:58
for better grind uniformity.
11:00
And that's what more expensive
11:02
hand grinders generally offer.
11:04
And at this price point
11:05
the grinds coming from this are very, very good.
11:07
And you can grind effectively
11:09
for espresso with an expensive hand grinder,
11:11
it's really hard work, but you can do it
11:13
or you can grind for filter coffee pretty well.
11:14
So that's kind of what you've spent with hand grinders
11:17
going from something pretty cheap,
11:19
cheaper materials, cheaper burr construction,
11:21
less uniformity, and that's what's increased
11:23
as you've gone up and up and up.
11:24
So there are lots of reasons to have a hand grinder.
11:26
It might be that you travel a lot,
11:28
it might be that you like camping,
11:29
it might be that just you enjoy that whole thing.
11:31
But if you are at home
11:32
you're grinding coffee every single day,
11:34
then I would recommend investing
11:35
in an electric coffee grinder.
11:38
And that's where we start here.
11:39
So this grinder here is cheaper than this hand grinder.
11:41
It's a little bit more expensive than this grinder here,
11:44
but it's a great way to start the day.
11:46
You have an electric motor in there
11:48
and that spinning a conical burr set.
11:50
And that's what you tend to see
11:51
at entry-level decent home electric grinder price points.
11:55
Now cheaper grinders will have cheaper motors
11:58
and because grinding coffee is hard work,
12:01
a cheaper motor will overcome
12:02
the sort of power needed to crush those beans
12:05
by just spinning faster.
12:06
So you'll tend to see cheaper grinders
12:08
have faster RPMs on their motors.
12:10
They don't always grind coffee through the burrs quicker,
12:13
but they will generally be a little bit louder.
12:16
That motor spinning generates some noise,
12:18
if it's spinning very fast, the way it cuts coffee
12:20
you'll just get a bit more noise in the morning.
12:22
This grinder, as you tend to see at this price point
12:24
is a stepped grinder.
12:25
So you've got fixed steps
12:26
and it's not really able to do espresso, right?
12:30
We talked about having a cheaper motor
12:31
spinning a bit faster,
12:33
but when you're grinding very, very, very fine
12:35
you need a lot of power,
12:36
you need a lot of talk in that motor
12:38
and cheaper motors just can't do it.
12:40
So you tend to see cheaper grinders like this are great
12:43
if you need filter coffee,
12:44
but not great if you're trying to brew espresso.
12:47
If you look at say a filter dedicated grinder
12:49
at about 125 pounds going up to say 250 pounds,
12:54
then you see a variation in the features
12:56
that's kind of interesting.
12:56
This grinder was initially designed
12:58
to hold like a bag of coffee in the hopper here
13:00
and have a little timer on the side
13:02
that you would adjust it, you'd push go
13:03
and it would grind for a fixed amount of time
13:05
to dispense the amount of coffee that you wanted.
13:07
But that's not how many people
13:09
want a coffee grinder to work.
13:10
You want what's called a single dose grinder.
13:12
Where you're gonna put in what you need
13:14
and no more in terms of coffee beans
13:16
for that drink, that batch, whatever it's gonna be.
13:18
It might be that you wanna keep the coffee stored
13:20
and sealed away and not sitting in the grinder.
13:22
It might be that have more than one coffee at home
13:25
and you wanna vary one bean to the next.
13:27
A grinder like this is designed to be a single-dose grinder.
13:30
You can't really fit that much coffee on the top here,
13:32
so you'd only pour in what you'd need.
13:34
Instead of having a timer
13:36
this has an auto shutoff that stops the grinder
13:38
when it's no longer grinding coffee.
13:40
This grinder, like this grinder is a stepped grinder.
13:42
So you've got fixed increments
13:43
that you can adjust the grind size by.
13:45
And this grinder is also a filter coffee only grinder,
13:48
it's motor it's set up is really built around
13:50
filter coffee and not espresso.
13:52
What you tended to see historically
13:54
was when you need espresso
13:56
you had a dedicated espresso style grinder.
13:59
And this is a pretty good example.
14:00
It's a bit of a jump in price
14:01
because you've got a more substantial motor in there
14:04
and this is about I think 350 pounds
14:06
which is some pretty serious money.
14:07
Now this is designed really
14:10
to be a dedicated espresso grinder.
14:11
And it's a little bit more traditional in its design,
14:14
which means it's got a large hopper on top
14:16
to again, hold a big bag of coffee beans in there
14:18
and grind what you need when you need it.
14:21
Many people choose not to do that as I said,
14:23
and use this as single dose,
14:24
though you'd probably wanna replace this hopper
14:26
with something more appropriate.
14:27
What you see as you go from a filter coffee
14:30
dedicated grinder to an espresso dedicated grinder
14:32
is not just the ability to grind finer,
14:34
but you tend to see stepless adjustment, right?
14:38
Where you control the finest or the coarseness
14:40
it's usually just a wheel
14:41
that you can move as little or as much as you want.
14:43
Espresso requires very small adjustments to grind in size
14:46
to have quite a substantial change
14:48
in the way that the coffee brews.
14:49
So you want as much control as is possible.
14:52
So that's what you tend to see
14:54
in a dedicated espresso grinder.
14:55
This will grind using time.
14:57
So you push go and it'll grind for say 9.2 seconds
15:00
to give you a consistent dose of coffee.
15:02
This kind of grinder, you can buy in a huge number
15:04
of different configurations from different manufacturers.
15:06
You'll have different motor sizes,
15:08
different burrs sizes, different burr shapes,
15:10
you know, different kind of technologies
15:12
controlling how much coffee it grinds as it grinds.
15:15
But the base principle is kind of there.
15:17
If you're grinding for espresso
15:18
you need that more powerful motor
15:20
and that tends to mean you need to spend more money
15:22
and that's where your money is going.
15:24
Now, these two grinders are emblematic
15:26
of more modern approaches to grinders.
15:28
This kind of grinder has existed
15:30
for 60, if not 70 years now.
15:32
These are much newer,
15:34
as you'll see they're both grind to order grinders
15:36
they have no real space to hold much coffee,
15:38
they'll hold a single dose under no more,
15:40
but they're also designed to go all the way
15:42
from coarser filter grinds
15:44
through to very fine espresso grinds.
15:46
This one is a flat burr grinder
15:48
and this one is a conical burr grinder.
15:50
This one is a little bit cheaper
15:51
I think at about 400 pounds,
15:52
this one is a little bit more expensive at 500 pounds.
15:55
Feature wise, they're both very similar
15:56
you're grinding into a little collection bin
15:58
that you might then use to pour into a pour-over
16:00
or pour directly into a portafilter
16:02
if you're making a espresso.
16:03
Now the difference of price between the two
16:04
might come down to the design and construction of these,
16:07
the materials used or the components used,
16:10
it might also come down
16:11
to their approach to things like retention.
16:13
Now retention isn't something that we've talked about yet
16:15
but it is something that's actually very important
16:17
and you'll see discussed
16:18
in a lot of different grinder reviews.
16:20
When you put coffee beans into a grinder
16:22
it'll go into a chamber that holds the cutting discs
16:24
those spin, those push out the grounds,
16:27
ideally all of them,
16:28
but typically not quite all of them.
16:31
There might be anywhere from 0.2 of a gram to two grams
16:35
or even sometimes more stuck inside the grinder
16:37
that the mechanism is unable to completely push out.
16:40
Now with more traditional designs like this one
16:42
that wasn't considered a huge issue
16:45
because, you know, it'll be pushed out
16:47
when you grind for coffee the next time.
16:49
The downside is when you change your grind
16:51
you'll have some of the retained old grind setting
16:54
that you would need to purge out.
16:56
That's a little bit wasteful
16:57
and the more you need to purge out with a grinder,
17:00
the more wasteful that grinder is.
17:01
Some commercial grinders can need 20 or 30 grams purging,
17:05
not acceptable, but that's how things were for a long time.
17:07
More modern solutions might need a couple of grams,
17:10
if anything at all.
17:11
So design around retention is really a key thing.
17:14
Here you've got quite a different approach,
17:16
the retention is dealt with by the sort of innate design
17:18
of the burr chamber.
17:19
Here you've got a bellows
17:21
where you'd push down that would blow air
17:22
through the grinding chamber
17:24
pushing out the last bit of coffee
17:25
into the collection cup below.
17:27
That's the kind of idea there.
17:28
How a grinder deals with retention,
17:30
be it bellows or be it a little knocker
17:32
on the side of it is something you should think about,
17:35
and decide how you wanna spend your money
17:37
because it will impact your kind of workflow in the morning.
17:39
Do you wanna have to go and clack a thing a few times
17:41
or press the bellows a few times?
17:43
If it doesn't bother you and it saves you some money,
17:46
then it's worth considering.
17:47
But retention is important
17:48
and retention is discussed a lot
17:50
when you watch other reviews of grinders on YouTube
17:52
or read about them on websites.
17:53
So the understanding I think is really, really, really key.
17:56
Now, one last note on conical versus flat burrs
17:59
and I don't want to get too deeply
18:01
into an esoteric discussion here,
18:03
but some people believe that conical burrs
18:05
suit espresso a little bit more.
18:07
That having a little bit more diversity of size of particle
18:10
can help give some more texture,
18:12
some more body to your espresso.
18:14
Other people prefer sort of flat burr style espresso
18:17
where you have a little bit more clarity,
18:18
maybe more sweetness, but not quite as much texture.
18:21
Understanding that is a consideration
18:23
if you're getting into the fine end
18:25
of dialing into espresso,
18:26
when you've got a great machine
18:27
and you want a great grinder to match it.
18:29
But if it's your first grinder
18:31
it's not something you necessarily need to obsess
18:33
about until your technique
18:34
and other aspects of coffee making catch up to that.
18:37
Now, one last note on burrs is that some grinders
18:40
have options for different burrs that you can install.
18:43
Grinders like this or this,
18:44
you can install different burrs
18:46
from different manufacturers
18:47
that will give you different results.
18:49
If you are shopping for a grinder
18:50
and you're kind of wanting to future-proof it,
18:52
considering a grinder that has some options
18:55
for a grinder burrs is one thing
18:57
to maybe just bear in mind as you're shopping.
18:59
That's not essential, but it is a kind of nice to have,
19:03
if you're thinking about buying a grinder
19:04
that's gonna last you for a really long time
19:06
without worrying about needing to constantly upgrade.
19:09
Now, these nine grinders I have here
19:11
are I think viable first-time purchases,
19:13
even though we've gone all the way up to 500 pounds.
19:15
I could see this still being
19:17
someone's first coffee grinder at home.
19:18
I did want to include a little bit more
19:20
just to explain how people can end up spending
19:23
enormous amounts of money on coffee grinders
19:25
for what they're chasing.
19:26
Now, this grinder in the end is incredibly expensive
19:28
it's three and a half thousand dollars
19:30
but I think it's a good example of how far people will go
19:32
in the chase for better uniformity, better construction
19:36
or better design or better build, more control
19:38
here you've got variable RPM.
19:40
I can change the speed of my motor
19:42
to achieve different results in how it grinds.
19:45
The workflow is kind of different and very nice.
19:47
It's beautiful, I can easily switch the burrs out in it.
19:50
You know, these kind of details
19:51
are what you end up paying for.
19:53
Now understand that going from a more entry-level grinder
19:56
to something like this is a big leap in quality
19:59
and a great return on your investment.
20:01
Going from someone like this, up to someone like this,
20:04
is an increasing quality, but it's a smaller leap,
20:06
it's more incremental increase for a lot more money.
20:09
And that's true of most things in this world, right?
20:12
Like the closer you get to sort of the end goal,
20:15
the more expensive and the more difficult
20:16
it is to do any sort of an upgrade.
20:18
I'm not saying this is bad value for money,
20:20
but if you're looking at spending
20:21
a lot of money on the coffee grinder,
20:23
you really have to have some very specific problems
20:25
that only it will solve for you.
20:27
As a final note, these look like they go
20:29
from sort of the lowest quality to the highest quality,
20:32
but that isn't quite true.
20:34
Hand grinders are a cheaper way to achieve better quality,
20:38
better grind uniformity at lower prices
20:41
'cause you don't have to spend money on the motor,
20:43
so you're just spending on burr and construction generally.
20:46
So that is the beginner's guide to coffee grinders.
20:49
And it's there a hope to help you build a little flow chart
20:51
for you and your needs and your budget.
20:54
If you've got 300 pounds
20:56
and you want a filter coffee grinder,
20:58
then I can help you get to where you need to go
21:00
based on your needs.
21:01
Do you want absolute quality for the money
21:03
or do you want electric motor
21:05
to help you do some of the work?
21:07
These are questions I can't answer for you,
21:09
but hopefully now you can answer them for yourself
21:11
and make a better decision.
21:13
And do know there are still things
21:14
that we haven't talked about here
21:15
that are little details
21:16
that are worth looking out for in reviews.
21:18
Things like the, not just the loudness of a grinder,
21:20
but the quality of sound.
21:22
Does it great on you?
21:23
That kind of stuff.
21:23
Things like the user interface,
21:25
does it frustrate you?
21:26
Is it quirky?
21:27
Is it frustrating?
21:28
Is it finicky?
21:28
Those things are important and should be looked out for
21:31
when you're checking out a review before you purchase.
21:34
But now I wanna hear from you down in the comments below.
21:37
Do you have one of these?
21:38
Are you thinking about upgrading to one of these?
21:40
What are you looking for in a coffee grinder?
21:42
And how has this video potentially helped you
21:44
make a better decision?
21:46
I'd love your feedback, I'd love your thoughts.
21:48
But for now, I'll say thank you so much for watching
21:50
and I hope you have a great day.

- Welcome to Episode Two
0:19
of the Ultimate Grinder Showdown Week.
0:21
Today, we're looking at the EG-1 from Weber Workshops.
0:25
This is a three and a half thousand dollar grinder
0:29
and it is a grinder obsessed with detail.
0:32
Weber Workshops started out back in 2014 as Lyn Weber,
0:35
Craig Lyn, I think, departed the company in 2018
0:38
and it became Weber Workshops.
0:40
This is their electric grinder, I assume, EG.
0:42
They do a HG as well, which is a hand grinder
0:45
but this is the one that I was very interested in.
0:47
Now a lot has been made
0:48
over the years over Douglas Weber's history
0:51
as one of the team that worked on the Apple iPod.
0:53
His background is in manufacturing and design,
0:56
and it really shows in this particular grinder.
1:01
And I think a good introduction to it
1:02
is just to sort of walk you from top to bottom
1:05
and highlight some of the details in the build,
1:08
construction, and sort of the way that this thing works
1:11
that I think is just stunning.
1:13
Starting at the top of the grinder,
1:14
you can see the sort of fan at the top here,
1:17
keeping the motor cool,
1:18
moving down you've got a beautiful little bean funnel.
1:20
This is attached on two locking pins and a magnet.
1:23
So you don't actually need any tools to detach it.
1:26
Those magnets are going to become a little bit
1:28
of a theme for this grinder.
1:30
Moving down, we have the locking ring here
1:32
for your grind setting.
1:33
And this is the only grinder that we're going to look at
1:36
in this whole week that actually locks it's grind setting.
1:38
Now that locking does mean it is a stepped grinder.
1:41
So you can see the little markings here for each step.
1:43
You lift this, move it, and drop it down
1:46
into whichever step, finer or coarser, that you want to go.
1:49
As you'd expect, moving towards smaller numbers
1:51
takes you finer,
1:52
then moving towards larger numbers takes you coarser.
1:55
The steps I think are small enough.
1:58
Certainly there are times where I wish they were
2:00
a little tiny bit smaller, but I'm being very fussy there.
2:02
I've never really had any major issues dialing in
2:05
an espresso to be just the way that I want them.
2:07
Moving down, we end up with this little platform here
2:09
and on this is the Blind Shaker.
2:11
That is the one accessory that comes with this
2:12
that I'll talk about a little bit more in a second.
2:15
Now this platform is on a spring
2:16
so you can tilt it forward to easily remove it.
2:18
And that way, when it sat there
2:20
the shaker sat close to the exit chute to minimize mess or
2:23
or sort of spray from static.
2:25
This button here allows you to move it
2:27
up and down as you wish.
2:29
It's a very nice little detail.
2:32
Beyond that you've got a start stop button
2:34
and you've got a dial here for controlling
2:37
the RPM of the grinder.
2:39
And this runs up to about 1800 RPM
2:41
which is probably higher than you'd want to go.
2:43
I've generally run this at about 600 RPM
2:45
most of the time.
2:47
That isn't where the detail finishes
2:48
and just looking at it, touching it,
2:50
you can see the machining tolerances are tiny.
2:53
Everything fits together beautifully.
2:55
This is manufactured and assembled
2:57
in Taiwan and shipped from there at the moment.
2:59
Coming around the side,
3:02
small little bean knocker
3:04
that I think is a nice little detail
3:05
but it's attached to these outer pieces here.
3:08
And this is I think just a little piece of magic.
3:11
This is where the burrs are inside the grinder.
3:13
So if you want to access the burrs,
3:14
this pulls out,
3:17
this comes out and you've actually exposed the burrs.
3:21
They're sat right here, inside the grinder,
3:22
very close to each other,
3:24
cause we're in an espresso setting right now, but that's it.
3:26
If you want to clean that burr chamber,
3:29
no tools required whatsoever.
3:32
That I think is, is beautiful.
3:34
It's so elegant.
3:35
It's so nicely done.
3:37
They fit together so nicely
3:38
and everything feels just really well-made.
3:43
And it would need to be because this thing is
3:45
three and a half thousand dollars
3:48
that is incredibly expensive for a coffee grinder.
3:50
So you'd really want to know where your money is going
3:52
and build, design, is unquestionably a big part of that.
3:56
Let's put it back together.
4:01
I mean, that's just ridiculous, isn't it?
4:03
How simple is that?
4:04
And then you have your, your one accessory to this
4:06
which is the Blind Shaker.
4:08
Essentially inside you've got this piece
4:10
that acts as a sort of stopper at the bottom
4:13
of this sort of catch bin.
4:15
So this drops and you would grind into this thing.
4:19
This sits on top to hold everything in place.
4:21
So you can give it a good shake that would get rid
4:23
of any clumps,
4:24
help with better sort of distribution of particles.
4:26
And then you would place this on your portafilter
4:27
and ultimately pull this out and the coffee
4:29
would fall through it into the portafilter below.
4:31
Everything fits together very well, feels very nice,
4:34
feels very solid and well-made.
4:37
Now the grinder does not come with a little spray bottle
4:40
and I prefer to use a little spray bottle
4:42
with this from a sort of messiness perspective
4:45
having the blind shaker sit pretty close
4:47
to the exit chute does reduce mass
4:49
but if you don't do this, you do get a bit of static.
4:51
You will see some chaff round and about the grinder
4:53
and that can be frustrating, a little bit messy.
4:57
Let's pull a shot.
5:02
(coffee grinding)
5:07
Now, as you watch the RPM counter,
5:09
as well as listen to the grinder, you can hear
5:11
that the grinder is trying to achieve the desired RPM.
5:14
And it's doing that
5:15
by varying the amount of power being sent
5:18
to the motor to try and keep it at that RPM.
5:20
It will drift around a little bit.
5:22
So if your target is 600
5:23
it will sometimes be below, sometimes above;
5:25
it'll kind of wander around. When you finally
5:27
clear the coffee from the burr set,
5:29
it's suddenly easier to spin faster
5:31
so the RPM will go up and then come back down again.
5:34
It's not my favorite part of this grinder.
5:36
I liked that the RPM is controllable,
5:38
but that's true of most of the grinders
5:40
we're going to test this week.
5:41
I don't love the way it executes that.
5:43
It just doesn't sound as nice
5:46
as this grinder feels and looks and generally is to use.
5:49
I don't think it's doing anything bad
5:51
to the coffee by any stretch.
5:52
It's just a complaint of mine.
6:02
Once you've removed your central piece there,
6:04
you need to give it a little swirl
6:06
and then it will distribute generally pretty well.
6:10
(upbeat music)
6:18
So let's talk about the burr set.
6:20
This grinder comes with their core burr set,
6:23
which is a little bit
6:24
like the Lagom P64, a hybrid burr set.
6:27
You can get a more unimodal set
6:29
as an additional sort of upgrade or add-on so to speak.
6:33
But this one is designed for
6:35
both espresso and brewed coffee,
6:37
and I think it works well.
6:38
Profile wise, it's closer to a
6:41
sort of more unimodal profile,
6:42
where espresso is sweet and clean and balanced,
6:44
but not a ton of texture
6:46
but not absent texture either.
6:48
I think it's a nice sort
6:49
of hybrid burr from that perspective,
6:50
there are other options
6:51
that are more espresso-focused as well.
6:54
And if you're using this
6:54
as nothing but a brewed coffee grinder then I
6:56
would consider the upgrade to a unimodal burr set,
6:59
that or a more unimodal burr set anyway.
7:02
Now you might think that the Blind Shaker
7:03
is really built for espresso,
7:05
but I actually really like it
7:06
for most filter coffee applications.
7:08
It's a nice way to distribute coffee bang
7:09
into the centre of a V60,
7:10
you can get coffee into an aeropress with a little funnel.
7:12
It works well for most brewing methods.
7:14
I don't have any issues with that.
7:16
I don't wish it came with something different
7:17
for grinding for filter coffee.
7:18
And its profile for filter coffee
7:20
we will discuss in more depth
7:22
in the head-to-head review
7:24
at the end of the week,
7:25
where it will be much more comparative
7:26
tasting between all of these grinders.
7:28
Now, one thing that I really love about the setup
7:30
of this grinder is the way that the burrs are mounted
7:32
on this thing.
7:34
In most grinders,
7:34
you'll expect to see two sometimes three screws
7:38
in the burrs holding them in place.
7:40
That is not the case with this grinder
7:42
On this grinder, the burrs are held in place
7:44
by a combination of pins and magnets, again.
7:45
That means that the burrs themselves
7:48
have no unusual holes in them for putting screws through.
7:53
Now, a lot of people worry about what happens
7:55
if they chip a little bit of a burr
7:56
if a stone or something gets into their coffee, right?
7:59
That's small damage to one of the cutting teeth.
8:01
Does that ruin your espresso?
8:03
I don't think it does,
8:05
but it will have an impact
8:06
much the same way that in every burr set
8:08
having three holes that don't have cutting teeth
8:12
inside them must impact the burr set.
8:15
With this, it's completely uniform.
8:17
Every piece of the burr is the same all the way around
8:20
and I think that's super cool
8:21
and I think that does help produce
8:22
excellent results in the cup.
8:24
So to summarize, let's talk through
8:26
the things that I like
8:27
and the things that I don't like as much.
8:30
What I like unquestionably is the build.
8:33
It's so well-made,
8:35
every detail just feels thought through,
8:37
the materials choice,
8:39
it looks beautiful.
8:40
This is a incredibly well-made thing
8:43
and that brings me pleasure to look
8:45
at in the morning,
8:46
to use day-to-day.
8:47
I think the way that it comes to pieces
8:49
is incredibly thoughtful as well.
8:51
I love that you can access the burr chamber
8:53
with zero tools in less than 10 seconds.
8:56
I think the detail everywhere,
8:58
from the spring lever here,
8:59
the little thwacker at the back there,
9:00
it's all great detail.
9:02
I think it makes delicious coffee incredibly enjoyable.
9:06
It is a big grinder.
9:07
There's no denying this.
9:08
It's tall.
9:09
It won't fit under most countertops, it's relatively wide.
9:12
It's not that deep, but it is a big, pretty heavy thing.
9:15
This may not fit in every home
9:17
but if you've got space in your kitchen
9:18
and space wherever you make your coffee
9:21
it would probably look pretty great there.
9:23
I think it can be a bit messy
9:25
if you don't use a little spray bottle now and again,
9:27
and that has been a frustration
9:28
when I've used lighter roasted coffees
9:29
that do have a little bit more chaff around them.
9:31
I wish that the way that it sounded when
9:34
it's grinding sounded a little bit different.
9:35
I wish it wasn't hunting out its desired RPM
9:38
and sort of moving around in that manner.
9:41
It doesn't reassure me the way that the build
9:43
of this thing does overall.
9:45
I don't think it impacts coffee
9:46
but it does somewhat impact my experience.
9:50
Then there's the price.
9:51
It's three and a half thousand dollars
9:53
before it is shipped to you wherever you are in the world.
9:55
And I paid about $150 in shipping.
9:57
That is a staggering amount of money.
10:00
Whether it's worthwhile is a question
10:02
you have to ask yourself
10:03
and it's not the only grinder we'll look at
10:05
at that kind of a price point,
10:06
but it is incredibly expensive.
10:08
But you see where your money is going.
10:11
And I think that's important.
10:13
I think that's what you want to see.
10:14
Every detail here has been considered.
10:16
Every materials choice has obviously been considered
10:18
and that's, that's hard not to like.
10:21
It's a very aesthetic experience.
10:23
It's very enjoyable.
10:24
I am impressed.
10:26
Do I wish it was cheaper?
10:27
Absolutely. Do I think it's overpriced?
10:29
No, I do not.
10:31
It's a small company producing
10:32
a small number of beautiful things.
10:34
They're not buying tens of thousands of pieces
10:37
to bring the costs down.
10:38
They don't have scale to bring that cost down.
10:40
And so I am understanding of that high, high price
10:43
but if you've got the cash,
10:44
if this appeals to you,
10:47
then I think you'll have a very enjoyable coffee experience
10:49
with this grinder.
10:50
I don't get to keep this particular grinder
10:52
because this goes to one of my Patreon supporters
10:54
because my Patreon supporters give me a budget every month
10:56
to go and buy equipment to review for you.
10:59
And because I buy it
11:00
I don't get loaners or freebies from manufacturers.
11:02
The reviews I hope are unbiased.
11:04
I'll certainly miss having this grinder around.
11:06
And if you want to know which one
11:08
of these five that I would keep,
11:10
well, then you'll have to watch the head-to-head
11:11
coming a little bit later.
11:14
If it's live, there'd be a link
11:15
in the description down below.
11:16
If not hope you tune in very soon for the next episode
11:19
of this ultimate grinder showdown.
11:21
For now I'll say thank you so much for watching.
11:24
I hope you have a great day.

0:18
- Welcome to episode three
0:19
of the "Ultimate Grinder Showdown."
0:21
Today, we're looking at the Mahlkönig EK43S.
0:25
And I think it's safe to say,
0:27
that this is probably the most influential piece
0:29
of coffee equipment in the last 10 years.
0:31
First, some history of this company and this grinder.
0:34
So Mahlkönig as a company goes back to 1924.
0:37
They weren't called Mahlkönig then,
0:38
but they made motors for grinders or mixers
0:42
or food processing, that kind of stuff.
0:44
They began to concentrate on coffee grinders in the 1960s
0:46
and trade more heavily under the Mahlkönig brand.
0:49
They actually formally became Mahlkönig in 2005,
0:52
but they're now part of the Hemro Group.
0:53
Now at the end of the 1970s,
0:55
they began to produce this model.
0:57
Now, the name EK43 is not a beautiful name,
1:00
but it does make some sense.
1:02
The E stands for Einphasenstrom,
1:04
which is the German for single phase.
1:06
When it comes to motors and things like grinders,
1:08
whether it is single phase or three phase,
1:10
is really quite important.
1:11
And you'll still see DK grinders from Mahlkönig,
1:13
which is Dreiphasenstrom, made today.
1:16
So E for Einphasenstrom, K for Kaffee,
1:19
the German spelling of coffee.
1:21
43 is the motor designation.
1:23
There was a 23.
1:25
They presume there was a 33,
1:26
but no one seems to know anything about it.
1:28
The S in this particular model is
1:30
because this is a shorter version of that grinder.
1:33
There were several different versions
1:35
of this grinder made for different things.
1:37
There was one for pepper, one for linseed,
1:39
one for poppy seed, one for grains generally,
1:41
and they had different letters after the E.
1:43
So the EP was for pepper, in that particular case.
1:47
It was a generally successful product
1:49
from its initial sort of beginnings.
1:51
It had its fans.
1:52
It had people who didn't really care about it.
1:54
It did do a pretty cool version called the EKK,
1:57
which was sort of two hoppers, two grinders in one,
1:59
and that was kind of fun.
2:00
But it wasn't really until around 2009, 2010
2:04
that it had a dramatic change in its trajectory
2:07
and came into the spotlight.
2:09
So in 2009, 2010, a guy called Scott Rao is experimenting
2:12
with his one in a cafe he was involved in at the time
2:14
called Cafe Myriade in Montreal.
2:16
And he noticed when brewing with his FETCO
2:17
that he was able to push his extractions much higher
2:20
than he had expected to taste good.
2:23
23, 24% of the coffee being extracted back then
2:26
was a surprisingly high number.
2:28
And that became part of the kind of workflow in that cafe.
2:31
It was an influential cafe,
2:33
and a few different people came by
2:34
and learnt about this particular thing,
2:36
one being a guy called Ben Kaminsky,
2:38
who was the person who told me about this whole thing,
2:40
and another, a guy called Matt Perger.
2:42
Now, Matt would hugely popularize this grinder by using it
2:46
as part of his World Barista Championship routine
2:47
and talking about brewing espresso with this
2:51
to achieve very high extraction yields.
2:53
No one had really been doing that.
2:55
And those of us had found out about this,
2:57
we were starting to experiment
2:58
and try to understand why was this doing this?
3:02
What was special about this grinder?
3:04
In truth, Mahlkönig themselves had no idea
3:07
this grinder was special.
3:09
In fact, it was slated to be discontinued in 2013,
3:12
though the boom in its popularity
3:13
obviously prevented that from happening.
3:15
It drove the conversation about more unimodal grinding,
3:19
more evenness in grinding
3:21
and how that can impact extraction,
3:22
how we can have higher extractions,
3:24
potentially better tasting coffee as a result.
3:26
And this thing just boomed in popularity;
3:29
Mahlkönig could not make enough of these things,
3:31
and today it's still struggled to keep up with demand.
3:34
They're a staple in just about every specialty coffee shop
3:36
around the world.
3:37
They are still incredibly popular.
3:40
Now, despite all of this, despite its influence,
3:42
despite how clearly excellent it is at what it does,
3:45
reviewing it here does feel a little bit unfair.
3:48
Of these five grinders,
3:50
this is different from the others
3:52
because it's built first and foremost
3:54
for a commercial environment.
3:56
That has a number of different impacts,
3:57
but we'll start with an obvious one, which is the price.
4:00
This thing typically costs around $3,000,
4:03
but prices will fluctuate because the distribution
4:05
of this grinder is different
4:07
to all the other grinders I'm reviewing.
4:09
With the other grinders,
4:10
I bought them direct from manufacturer,
4:12
shipped from wherever they were in the world, to me here.
4:15
With this, with commercial equipment,
4:18
distribution works differently.
4:19
Mahlkönig would have built this grinder
4:21
and sold it to a national distributor.
4:23
And that national distributor probably didn't sell it
4:25
to an end user or to a cafe.
4:27
It probably went through a dealer.
4:28
And so, typically, with this kind of model,
4:30
you end up with the person who sells it
4:32
to the cafe or the end user,
4:33
being able to offer them more support
4:35
because they're local to them or something like that.
4:37
But this kind of distribution model
4:39
means that there are several businesses
4:40
between manufacturer and user making some money.
4:44
And so while this might be a $3,000 grinder,
4:47
that certainly isn't what Mahlkönig as a manufacturer
4:50
would have charged for it.
4:51
And so its distribution model is definitely
4:54
a challenge when it comes to competing
4:56
with these other grinders.
4:58
However, Mahlkönig as a manufacturer has an advantage
5:02
that these other grinder manufacturers do not.
5:04
And that is scale.
5:05
Mahlkönig builds tens of thousands of grinders a year,
5:07
possibly more.
5:08
They are manufacturing an enormous number of these,
5:11
and that brings costs down in both parts and labor costs.
5:15
They have built production around high volume,
5:18
and that makes it cheaper to make.
5:19
In the case of some of these grinders,
5:21
they're being built by hand, by passionate people
5:24
who might even own the company that you're buying from.
5:27
It's a very different model, and that's worth bringing up.
5:29
And secondly, because it's built for cafes,
5:31
that has a massive impact
5:32
on its workflow and its purpose.
5:35
Now, in the other grinders, I've talked about accessories.
5:38
This comes with none, nothing whatsoever,
5:41
nothing to weigh into, nothing to grind into, not a thing.
5:45
Now, typically this might go to a cafe,
5:46
who if they're using it for, say, batch brewing,
5:49
they'd probably be weighing the beans out
5:50
in the paper filter, pouring it in,
5:52
and grinding it back into the paper filter
5:53
for a FETCO or a BUNN or something like that
5:55
and brewing that way.
5:56
Or most commonly, they're gonna use it to grind
6:00
a bag of coffee for a customer to take home.
6:02
A lot about this part of the grinder here
6:04
is built around grinding bags of coffee
6:07
because that's kind of what a lot of people use it for,
6:10
and it needs to be very good at that.
6:12
At home, your requirements are very different.
6:14
You're not gonna be grinding a hundred grams
6:16
of coffee for a FETCO brew,
6:16
you're not gonna be grinding 250 grams of coffee
6:19
for a bag of something to give to a friend or family member.
6:22
Realistically, you're gonna be grinding 20 grams
6:25
of coffee at a time.
6:26
And I don't really think this is built for that.
6:30
I'm gonna seem a little bit negative about this
6:32
because ultimately it does a good thing.
6:35
It grinds in a more uniform manner,
6:37
and it helps coffee taste better at higher extractions.
6:39
That isn't really up for debate,
6:41
but it's not built really to do it in the home.
6:45
It's just not.
6:46
And so using it at home is often a less enjoyable experience
6:50
than using it in a cafe is.
6:52
Now, there have been lots of cafes that have tried
6:54
to adapt this to to grind coffee
6:57
for every single espresso that they pull.
6:59
And you've seen people sort of create and manufacturer
7:02
additional items to help make that
7:04
a more enjoyable part of the process,
7:06
but those are expensive,
7:07
and, ultimately, it's still kind of a convoluted workflow.
7:11
But let's talk through the grinder just very quickly.
7:12
You can see at the back here
7:13
a very large motor mounted on this little stand here.
7:17
The normal EK has a larger piece here,
7:19
raising it up higher, making it easier
7:21
to get a bigger bag underneath.
7:23
People began modding these themselves,
7:25
and so Mahlkönig kind of copied that
7:26
and made a shorter version.
7:28
The dial on the front goes from 0 round to 16,
7:31
and that's your grind setting.
7:32
And again, smaller the number, finer the grind.
7:35
At 0, you're typically finer
7:36
than you would need for espresso.
7:38
And at 16, you're probably coarser
7:40
than you would need for something
7:41
like a French press or something else
7:42
that you might wanna brew with a coarse grind,
7:44
maybe cold brew if that's your thing.
7:45
It really does cover a full grind spectrum,
7:47
and it does grind well across every setting.
7:50
One small complaint from the get-go
7:52
is that they built this model to be shorter,
7:54
and that's good, especially for the home,
7:56
but what they chose to do was put on a very large hopper
7:59
on the top of it.
8:00
I don't really understand why they decided
8:02
to put such a long, tall hopper here
8:04
if they're making a shorter grinder.
8:06
It really makes no sense to me.
8:07
I will also say that the quality control on the hoppers
8:10
generally has been a bit of a problem.
8:11
I broke this hopper almost instantly upon using it.
8:15
It's got quite a difficult mechanism
8:17
that it locks onto the top of this with,
8:19
there's a little gasket inside here
8:21
and it sort of clicks in.
8:22
In the case of this one, the glue around the edge here
8:26
and on here was very poorly done.
8:29
And so it came almost straight off
8:30
when I tried to unlock the hopper.
8:32
That's really disappointing,
8:33
and ultimately this should be a better piece.
8:37
I will say that replacing this
8:39
with a better hopper would be high on my list
8:42
if I had one of these at home.
8:43
In addition, the hopper has a little sort of gate on there.
8:46
Some of the old ones would have a gate that swung out
8:49
but remained attached,
8:50
so you didn't pull it all the way out.
8:52
This one, you pull it all the way out.
8:53
And I don't actually like that,
8:55
'cause getting it back in again is a bit fussy.
8:57
You've got your vertically mounted burr set here,
8:59
a very large burr set as well.
9:01
Coffee drops sort of through them and down.
9:03
That's a very smart way to approach things.
9:05
Now, in terms of accessing the burrs on this thing,
9:07
it's not particularly difficult, but it does require tools.
9:10
So you're gonna open up the two screws here.
9:12
You'll be able to take this front piece off
9:13
and access the burrs that way.
9:15
It's not a particularly painful thing,
9:17
but it's not as easy as some of the other grinders in there.
9:19
But once you're inside, you'll see
9:20
there's some pretty chunky burrs in there.
9:22
Now the styling on this grinder is, I would say,
9:24
iconic at this point,
9:26
but I don't think it's super beautiful.
9:28
If you look back at some of the grinders they used to make,
9:30
like the W1BN, which was built in the '50s and '60s,
9:33
that I think is super beautiful.
9:35
And here, end of the '70s, beginning of the '80s,
9:38
a lot more boxier, straight lines.
9:40
I think that's kind of a shame.
9:42
Now, I guess what we should do is probably
9:43
pull a shot of espresso
9:44
and talk about that part of the process.
9:47
Now, again, I'm gonna be using a spray bottle
9:49
for my doses
9:50
because it does reduce the staticky mess
9:51
around one of these things.
9:53
Again, it doesn't come with a spray bottle.
9:54
There's no recommendation to use one,
9:56
but from my point of view, I certainly prefer it that way.
9:59
Now, when you're grinding for espresso,
10:00
you're obviously not gonna put a portafilter
10:02
underneath it here
10:03
because a terrible mess would ensue,
10:04
and that's just not recommended.
10:06
I'm gonna use the little dosing cap from a niche grinder
10:08
'cause that works super well.
10:10
It's a little bit surprising to me
10:11
that the EK43S in particular
10:13
does not come with something to grind it into.
10:15
The S is definitely even more popular
10:16
with people at home rather than cafes,
10:18
but you get nothing, which is kind of a shame.
10:22
Now, when it comes to grinding,
10:23
the motor is relatively loud.
10:25
(motor humming)
10:27
But it does grind very quickly.
10:31
(motor grinding)
10:35
Now, it does have a very effective knocker,
10:36
but that's really built to be a bag knocker.
10:38
You can see from the shape of this piece here,
10:40
this is designed for a retail bag,
10:41
to sit inside a retail bag.
10:43
And the knocker is designed to prevent a buildup
10:45
of ground coffee around the exit here,
10:47
keep it moving into the bag below.
10:49
It works fine to help clear it,
10:50
but this whole awkward piece here really isn't designed
10:53
for dosing some coffee for an espresso shot.
11:00
Now, with the style of espresso that people pull on an EK,
11:03
it's typically a longer shot.
11:04
It's not like a two to one.
11:05
It's more like a three to one, in some cases,
11:08
a much larger espresso.
11:09
And that's very common for unimodal style grinders.
11:14
The espresso you get from it is balanced.
11:17
It is sweet, it is clean,
11:19
but it doesn't have a ton of texture.
11:21
And that's a function of both unimodal grinders,
11:23
as well as those larger espresso ratios
11:25
that you typically use to get good espresso from them.
11:28
I enjoy this style of espresso though.
11:29
I often find myself missing a little bit of texture.
11:32
Now, when it comes to dialing these things in,
11:34
they are fussy and finicky and quite frustrating.
11:37
Retention is a little bit of an issue with this grinder,
11:40
wherein you'd almost benefit from a little purge
11:43
in between grind settings
11:44
in a way that some other grinders don't really need.
11:46
But with this one, I would recommend it.
11:49
Otherwise, you can find yourself chasing a grind setting
11:51
around and around and around,
11:53
and in my experience, where a coffee might be set
11:56
first thing in the morning or on one day,
11:58
you might need to dial it in again the next day.
12:01
It's a little bit more of a chase.
12:04
Some people don't really struggle with this,
12:05
but I've generally needed to redial in fairly often
12:08
with this with one particular coffee.
12:10
Your mileage may vary.
12:12
Now, this is probably more commonly used
12:13
for filter coffee than it is for espresso.
12:16
And we'll be testing filter coffee extractions
12:18
against the other grinders in that big showdown video
12:20
at the end of this week.
12:22
Obviously, it's very good at what it does.
12:24
Otherwise, it wouldn't have had the impact that it had.
12:27
It wouldn't have become the most popular grinder
12:29
in specialty coffee shops around the world.
12:31
It wouldn't have generated the hype, the interest,
12:33
the research, everything that has gone along with it.
12:36
This is a hugely influential grinder,
12:38
and you can't really argue that it isn't good
12:40
at what it does when you look at the impact
12:42
that it's had on the coffee industry.
12:44
And so you might be a little bit confused
12:45
because initially it seems like
12:47
I've had a bit of a rant against this thing,
12:49
but now I'm saying it's great at what it does.
12:51
And I feel like I'd hold those two opinions
12:53
and not feel any cognitive dissonance.
12:55
It is a great grinder for a cafe.
12:59
I don't really think it belongs at home.
13:01
In these videos,
13:02
we haven't talked a ton about alignment,
13:03
how perfectly aligned the two burrs are
13:06
to make sure there's no wobbling,
13:07
or no variance in grind size as they spin.
13:10
Historically, EK43s have needed some help with alignment.
13:14
And that's frustrated a lot of people.
13:16
This is an expensive grinder.
13:17
Why doesn't it come out of the box, perfectly aligned?
13:21
And I can't speak on behalf of Mahlkönig here,
13:24
but the number of grinders they're dealing with
13:25
is so much higher than almost any other manufacturer
13:28
who's obsessing about these kind of tolerances.
13:30
Historically, these had kind of been
13:32
all over the place sometimes.
13:33
The alignment had been a problem.
13:35
And with all of these reviews, I'm not touching that
13:38
with these grinders.
13:39
I'm reviewing them as stock because I think that's fair.
13:42
As a consumer, you should review what you get.
13:44
You shouldn't be reviewing
13:45
the modified, tweaked, improved versions of those things.
13:48
But it has been an issue with these grinders,
13:49
and it is seemingly getting better,
13:51
though I do worry a little bit about the QC with them,
13:53
with the volume that they're producing.
13:55
And it's the little details.
13:56
It's the fact that my hopper broke almost instantly.
13:59
It's the fact that these stickers,
14:00
which they've now changed,
14:01
but mine are just peeling off already,
14:03
and it's less than a month old.
14:04
These little details, they do bother me,
14:06
and they would bother me all the more
14:08
if I'd bought this to use at home
14:10
where I have a different kind of relationship
14:11
than I would do in a cafe
14:13
where I needed it to be a workhorse.
14:15
And it is a good, solid workhorse.
14:17
And so I can't avoid talking about this grinder
14:20
as part of this week's grinder reviews
14:22
because it is so influential, it is so important in coffee,
14:26
but it does sit out of place
14:29
compared to the other grinders
14:31
because it's built for a cafe,
14:32
and it's not built for home.
14:34
I will continue to buy these for businesses.
14:36
I will continue to use these almost every day.
14:39
But would I recommend that you put one in your home?
14:43
I don't know.
14:43
You'd have to think carefully about your workflow,
14:45
how you wanna work.
14:46
And for the price point, does it deliver the best results?
14:50
I will say it produces great tasting coffee, no question.
14:53
And when they're very well aligned,
14:54
really delicious coffee, really very good.
14:57
I have no complaints about the quality
14:58
that these things can produce at all.
15:01
But I am looking forward to pitting it
15:03
head to head in both espresso and filter coffee
15:06
against these other grinders.
15:07
Now, I don't get to keep this one.
15:09
I'm gonna give this one away
15:10
to one of my Patreon backers
15:11
because Patreon gives me a budget every month
15:12
to go and buy these grinders,
15:14
not be relying on freebies or loaners or that kind of stuff.
15:17
I can buy them, review them, tell you my honest thoughts,
15:20
and at the end, I can give them away.
15:22
And that makes me very happy.
15:23
But now I wanna hear from you
15:24
down in the comments below.
15:25
Tens of thousands of people around the world have these
15:27
in businesses and in homes,
15:29
let me know your experience.
15:30
Do your frustrations mirror my frustrations?
15:32
Have you modded it, adapted it in some way?
15:34
Do you like what I like?
15:36
Did I miss something?
15:37
I wanna hear from you down in the comments below,
15:39
but for now,
15:40
I say thank you so much for watching.
15:42
I hope you have a great day.
0:00
Hi there.
0:00
Today we're going to be talking about this.
0:02
It's the 9Barista Espresso Machine.
0:05
It's like a stove top mako pot
0:06
that actually makes espresso.
0:16
This was created by a guy called William Playford.
0:18
His background is a jet engineer.
0:20
That's his bonafides.
0:21
It's beautiful.
0:22
And it's very clever.
0:24
It has three pieces.
0:25
The top one, probably the least interesting.
0:28
We'll come back to that in a second.
0:29
The main body is two parts.
0:30
One of which is a water chamber at the bottom.
0:34
Initially, you might think this looks
0:35
just like the base of a moka pot.
0:36
There's a pressure release valve, necessary and safe
0:39
but it's more than that.
0:41
It's actually two water chambers.
0:43
And this is the first point
0:44
at which this thing is pretty clever.
0:46
Now you'd fill this with about 110 to 120 mils of water.
0:50
Cold water as recommended by the manufacturer.
0:53
And while I like to use boiled water in a moka pot,
0:55
I've done as they've asked in this case here
0:58
but all of the clever things are here
1:01
in this part, in the middle.
1:02
Now you'll see that this little piece
1:04
has two little red gaskets here
1:05
and they are what divide the two chambers.
1:08
So when you screw it in,
1:09
there is a chamber below this gasket.
1:11
And one above this gasket.
1:13
The bottom chamber is where water is boiled
1:16
and it's trapped until it reaches very high pressures
1:18
until it reaches nine bars of pressure.
1:21
I think that's about 179 degrees Celsius
1:24
but I could be wrong.
1:25
The upper chamber here is quite clever.
1:29
It's going to act as a cooling bath.
1:32
This is gonna be confusing when I tell you
1:34
that the water in that cooling bath
1:36
is gonna be 100 degrees Celsius
1:38
or it's going to be at whatever temperature water boils
1:41
wherever you are.
1:42
Here, I'm at sea level
1:43
so it's 100 degrees Celsius.
1:45
The way this thing works
1:46
is that you have this water trapped, boiling away madly
1:49
in the bottom section.
1:50
When it reaches nine bars of pressure,
1:52
it opens a spring release valve inside this unit
1:56
allowing water to flow into this coil.
1:58
Now this coil is surrounded,
2:00
it's jacketed by this boiling water,
2:02
which is much, much, much cooler than the water
2:05
going into that tube is.
2:08
It's kept at 100 degrees Celsius
2:09
because this chamber is only at atmospheric pressure.
2:12
There's a little chimney here on the side
2:14
that allows water to sort of boil, thus keeping it
2:17
at a fixed temperature.
2:18
In flowing through this coil,
2:19
it should drop from 179 down to
2:22
about 100 degrees Celsius,
2:24
it's still a little bit hot,
2:25
before entering the final section of this part of the body
2:28
which is an additional heat sink.
2:29
That's what these fins are for.
2:31
Therefore it should exit the shower screen effectively
2:34
at about 93, 94 degrees Celsius.
2:37
That's the theory.
2:38
What you have on top
2:39
is basically an upside down portafilter.
2:42
I mean, it's exactly a portafilter.
2:43
There's a basket here, it comes out.
2:45
There's a little handle, it's a portafilter.
2:48
But by having it upside down,
2:49
the pressure comes from underneath,
2:51
it's dispersed through a little dispersion block
2:53
that sits on top of the coffee,
2:54
I'll show you that in a minute, and then flows
2:57
into this little collection chamber where you pour it
2:59
out and drink your espresso at the end of it.
3:02
It's ingenious, to be honest,
3:05
it's a fascinating solution to the problem
3:07
of how do I generate nine bars of pressure on a stove top?
3:11
We'll brew some coffee, taste it, talk about it.
3:13
And then afterwards, I'll give you my overall thoughts
3:16
about how this works and ultimately, who is this for?
3:20
So I have everything
3:20
amongst this chaotic collection of things
3:22
in which I need to make espresso with the 9Barista.
3:25
Now, when you buy it, it comes with this.
3:27
It's an adapter desk for gas or induction.
3:29
So this on its own does not work on an induction hub.
3:33
So I've got a small little gas burner here
3:35
and it works for these as well
3:37
just to disperse the heat a bit more evenly
3:39
and make it so it fits safely on top of any sized ring.
3:43
It does also come with a very cute little tamper,
3:46
which is nice and obviously necessary.
3:48
So let's make some coffee in here.
3:50
I have my cold filtered, delicious water,
3:53
a little bit below the suggested level for reasons
3:56
we'll talk about in a second.
3:57
Now, when you put this together,
3:59
you'll see this becomes submerged
4:02
and the water begin to cover this section of the chamber.
4:06
If you overfill, you will make a mess.
4:11
With anything where you're going to be
4:12
generating high pressures, you want to make sure
4:14
your gaskets are properly seated
4:15
so this is nice and tight.
4:18
Don't make it impossible to undo later.
4:19
You won't thank yourself for that, but make sure it's tight.
4:23
So now to prep the basket.
4:24
Now they recommend 20 grams of coffee.
4:27
That's probably a pretty good catch-all dose, but for me
4:30
I certainly prefer slightly lower doses.
4:32
So I'm kind of in that 18 and a half, 19 range
4:35
with this, I think it's 'cause the coffee
4:37
I'm using is perhaps a touch lighter
4:38
and therefore a little bit harder to extract.
4:41
And as we know from the video
4:42
on starting dose for espresso dialing in, which is up here
4:45
if you want to watch that, then if you have a lighter roast
4:48
that it helps sometimes to use a lower dose.
4:50
And tamp.
4:52
One last piece to go on
4:53
is this sort of dispersion screen
4:55
that does two jobs, it disperses water
4:57
and also keeps the coffee in
5:00
when you turn it upside down,
5:01
both fairly important things.
5:03
Lock in the group head
5:04
and we're ready to make some coffee.
5:07
Now, the one challenge of this unit, I suppose
5:10
is that the dialing in process
5:11
if you're trying to brew coffee after coffee
5:12
after coffee, after coffee, it's pretty slow, actually.
5:17
Their ideal brew time
5:18
from going on from cold is six minutes.
5:21
And you kind of want to hit that brew time.
5:23
So brewing back to back,
5:25
certainly when you get the unit for the first time,
5:27
it's gonna take a little while to really
5:29
kind of dial in your process.
5:31
And that six minute time is kind of important, actually.
5:35
If you miss it then a couple of bad things can happen.
5:38
You can either potentially evaporate
5:40
all of the water in your upper chamber
5:43
because it will boil.
5:44
You could boil it so dry
5:45
that you end up insufficiently cooling your brewing water
5:48
and having an aggressive, steamy brew.
5:51
I've certainly done that when trying to find
5:53
that kind of right heat setting
5:55
for this particular unit.
5:56
You kind of want to work out and tweak and aim
5:59
for a six minute brew by testing.
6:03
You're gonna make some bad coffee when you get this.
6:05
You're unlikely to nail it out of the gate.
6:07
If you did well, well done you.
6:09
You're aiming for six minutes
6:10
and the trouble with that in some ways
6:13
as part of the dialing in process,
6:15
is that you don't know if it's gone wrong
6:16
until you get to six minutes and nothing's happened, right?
6:19
If you're heating it too slowly, at six minutes
6:21
you find out things have gone wrong.
6:23
That's a bit frustrating for me.
6:25
The dialing in process has definitely been
6:28
a little bit too slow and sort of drawn out.
6:32
And then you've got to cool it down,
6:33
take it to pieces, refill it.
6:35
It's not a back-to-back unit.
6:36
And certainly, it's not going to be great at producing lots
6:40
of coffee for lots of different people quite quickly.
6:43
This is something that you buy for you.
6:46
So now we're starting to hear some boiling
6:48
and that boiling is the upper chamber.
6:50
This is where I've had a couple of issues
6:52
and it's an issue that they know about.
6:54
And we'll talk a little bit about the fix afterwards
6:57
but that bubbling can be a little bit too angry,
7:00
a little bit too intense.
7:01
It coincides typically with the unit
7:04
really coming up to pressure and coffee happening
7:07
as long as you've got the heat right.
7:08
And at this point,
7:10
you kinda want to pay attention to what's going on.
7:12
You can have some issues
7:13
with water spitting out of the chamber
7:15
which is obviously bad, but coffee is now happening.
7:19
And it looks very good.
7:21
I have made some espresso.
7:30
Oh yeah.
7:31
So let's taste it in a second.
7:34
I'm just gonna put this in the sink,
7:35
cool it down a little bit.
7:37
So how is it?
7:38
Did it make delicious coffee?
7:40
Well it's pulled a decent size double.
7:42
It had some nice crema.
7:45
It's pretty good, it tastes like the coffee that went in.
7:49
Texture's nice.
7:49
You don't need to stir the shot because it's been stirred
7:51
by that kind of pouring action out of the 9Barista.
7:54
It would certainly work well as the base
7:57
of a milk drink if that's what you were interested in doing,
7:59
though obviously it has no method for heating milk.
8:02
As a straight shot though, pretty good.
8:05
I might drop the dose, tweak the grind a touch finer.
8:10
It's on the border of under extracted,
8:12
but that's on me and not on the machine so to speak.
8:15
Ultimately, it makes good tasting coffee.
8:18
It's certainly capable of producing the temperature
8:20
and the pressure that you would want.
8:22
It doesn't taste like a super hot shot.
8:25
You know what I mean?
8:26
When brew temperatures have gone a little bit too high,
8:27
it doesn't have that particular kind
8:29
of harsh bitterness that you get sometimes.
8:32
Pressure wise, it's hard to really know.
8:35
The physics, all that kind of stuff behind it
8:36
certainly make sense but I have no way
8:38
of measuring that effectively
8:40
so there's a bit of trust there.
8:42
What I will say is that it needs
8:43
a slightly courser grind than a traditional espresso machine
8:46
for the same kind of dose to flow normally,
8:49
which suggests possibly a slightly lower pressure.
8:51
It might be that the shot starts at nine bars
8:54
but obviously as pressure is released from the system,
8:56
that pressure may decline towards the end of the shot.
8:59
In order for this to appeal to you,
9:01
I think what you need is very limited space.
9:05
It is a good grinder for sure.
9:07
And no interest in milk drinks.
9:09
It's 295 pounds, which is expensive.
9:12
You can see where your money is going
9:14
in terms of design and build.
9:16
It's a small company, but I think that's probably
9:18
a fair price to achieve what they've achieved here
9:21
but it's still more expensive
9:23
than some traditional kind of lever machines.
9:25
Something like the Flair where, you know,
9:27
you're going to be adding the hot water
9:28
and the pressure yourself.
9:29
This is at least doing some of those things
9:31
for you and doing it in a controlled, repeatable way.
9:34
If you have a moka pot that you wished made espresso,
9:38
this is for you, but just you.
9:41
Again, it's not good at making multiple coffees
9:43
for multiple people
9:44
and it doesn't work particularly quickly.
9:47
But if you wish you could put
9:49
on a moka pot in the morning,
9:50
have a genuinely delicious espresso at the end of it,
9:53
this may be something for you to consider.
9:56
That doesn't mean I'm not without
9:57
some small criticisms of it.
9:58
It's a very well machined thing.
10:00
It seems to be done within very tight tolerances.
10:03
Though, I will say that locking in
10:04
the portafilter, there's just a little bit
10:06
too much play here as you lock it in.
10:08
I wish it was a little bit more tightly machined
10:11
from that perspective.
10:12
I've never had an issue with a seal not forming properly.
10:15
It just doesn't feel in line
10:16
with the rest of the machine as a whole.
10:18
It's just a funny little detail like that.
10:20
I do need to talk about the issue
10:22
with water exiting the chimney towards the end
10:23
of the brew or towards the beginning of espresso flowing.
10:26
They've addressed this in a blog post.
10:28
If you're getting very large bubbles of water,
10:30
it's because you potentially lack nucleation points.
10:33
Inside here where the water is boiling
10:34
in that secondary chamber,
10:36
everything's too smooth.
10:37
They discovered quite recently that if you
10:39
just sand a little bit just to rough up
10:42
some of the surfaces in there, that issue goes away
10:45
which I think is kind of interesting.
10:46
And also they've had people just use a little bit less
10:48
than 120 mil inside of the machine,
10:50
more like 110, and had no issues either.
10:53
As you saw, I had a little tiny issue,
10:55
but not a significant one.
10:56
I haven't done any roughing up inside of here.
10:58
I think they're going to change that
11:00
for future production runs.
11:01
This is number 278,
11:05
so it's still pretty early there
11:07
but I'm glad they addressed an issue
11:08
and I'm glad they've worked out
11:09
the problem and got a fix for it
11:10
even if it is something as simple as a piece of sandpaper.
11:13
The last criticism or thing to note is
11:16
that you don't have a ton of control here.
11:20
It's gonna do what it's gonna do.
11:22
You're not gonna be able to manipulate pressure
11:24
or temperature in any way.
11:26
And if you like coffees that brew
11:27
with ideal temperatures that are outside
11:30
of the kind of range it produces,
11:31
there's not much you'll be able to do.
11:33
I guess you could probably try something
11:36
inadvisable like dosing a little cold water
11:38
in to sort of drop the temperature
11:40
of the heat jacket just before it starts brewing.
11:43
But the timing on that seems like a chaotic thing
11:45
and I'm certainly not recommending that.
11:46
I'm just sort of thinking out loud.
11:48
As fixed as it is, it at least does
11:50
the things that it's supposed to do.
11:51
It produces consistent temperature and pressure
11:54
and it does it in an ingenious, clever,
11:56
and frankly, beautiful way.
11:58
The details on this are nice.
11:59
The wood handles are nice, it feels solid.
12:01
It feels well built.
12:03
It does have a couple of gaskets in there.
12:05
And to be honest, I did break one of them.
12:06
I'm not sure how, it's not shocking.
12:09
I can perhaps be a little bit rough with equipment at times.
12:12
I'm not like Casey Neistat with cameras,
12:14
but you know, I might be a little bit rough sometimes.
12:17
Just be aware that there are parts
12:19
that will wear over time.
12:20
So just two gaskets inside the machine,
12:22
they are what you will replace potentially longer term.
12:25
Overall, I'm pretty impressed.
12:27
I think it's clear.
12:29
I think it's beautiful.
12:29
I think it makes good tasting coffee.
12:31
I don't think it's for everybody
12:33
but if you've ordered one of these
12:35
because it fit the way you want to make coffee,
12:37
if it fits your life, I think you'll have a good time.
12:40
Now, I don't get to keep this.
12:41
This is going to go to one of my Patreon backers.
12:43
I'm very grateful that I have a Patreon
12:44
that gives me a budget to go and buy these things
12:46
and so I can make independent,
12:48
honest reviews of them and let you know what I think.
12:51
But you know, I'm a little bit sad to let go of it.
12:54
I wouldn't use it all the time,
12:56
but it would be a fun thing to show other people.
12:58
It would be a fun way to get people excited about coffee.
13:00
Seeing the kind of upside down
13:03
naked, portafilter things,
13:03
seeing the espresso fill from the bottom is unusual.
13:07
It's interesting.
13:08
It's beautiful, again.
13:09
Overall, it's expensive.
13:11
It's a little bit niche, but it does what it set out to do.
13:16
But now I wanna hear from you.
13:17
There's probably at least 300 of these in the world
13:19
if this is number 278.
13:21
So how are you getting on with it?
13:23
What kind of experience have you had?
13:25
How does the coffee taste?
13:26
Are you happy with your purchase?
13:27
Are you waiting for one of these?
13:29
Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below
13:32
but for now, I'll say thank you so much for watching
13:35
and I hope you have a great day.
